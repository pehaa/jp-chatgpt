Connect your site to your Facebook page Reconnecting Facebook How to use Jetpack Social with multiple Facebook pages Troubleshooting Jetpack Social Facebook Connections Facebook has made a change to their platform: Third party tools can no longer automatically share posts to Facebook profiles, only pages. This includes Jetpack Social. If you’d like to share your concerns with Facebook, you can visit their Help Center. Example post published on Facebook from Jetpack Social. Connect your site to your Facebook page (Note: There are also instructions for using Jetpack Social on multiple pages.) You will need to use a Facebook profile account that has administrative rights to the target page. A page-only account or a page managed by Facebook Business Manager cannot be used with Jetpack Social. If you’d like to remove a Facebook page from Facebook Business Manager, you can follow the instructions here. To get started, log in to Facebook. Next, navigate to Jetpack → Settings → Sharing from your WordPress dashboard and click “Connect your social media accounts.” This will take you to the connections page in your WordPress. com dashboard. Click the Connect button next to the Facebook logo. If this is the first site you’ve connected to your Facebook account, a message will appear asking permission for WordPress to receive your name and profile picture. Click Continue as *****. You’ll then be asked which pages you would like to connect to if you manage more than one. After clicking Next, you will be asked what you would like WordPress to have access to. By default, if you selected any pages in the previous step, all options will be toggled to “Yes” here. The pages you select here are the only ones that will be available for any other sites you may want to connect to in the future. If you need to update these settings in the future, you can do so from your Facebook Business Integrations settings).

To make the Facebook connection available to all users of the blog, start by clicking the arrow next to the Facebook option (as shown in the image below). Click to select the Connection available to all administrators, editors, and authors option. This will make sure that any other Jetpack-connected users will automatically publish through this Facebook connection when they publish a post on this site. Reconnecting Facebook Sometimes the connection between Facebook and Jetpack might get disconnected. Not to worry! You can follow the steps below to disconnect and reconnect your Jetpack to Facebook. Please do the following, in this specific order: Access your site Dashboard → Tools → Marketing → Connections. Look for your social media connection and click on the “Disconnect” button Disconnect Jetpack using these instructions. Remove WordPress from your allowed applications on your social media account(s). You can also revoke your Business Integrations here. Log back into your site. Navigate to Jetpack → Settings → Sharing from your WordPress dashboard and follow these steps to reconnect. How to use Jetpack Social with multiple Facebook pages Jetpack Social doesn’t allow you to auto-share to multiple pages from a single account. However, you can add a new connection to a different Facebook account from within the same Jetpack Social connection. In other words, one site can connect to many Facebook accounts, but only one Facebook page per connected Facebook account can be connected to Jetpack Social. Each Facebook page you would like to add to the same Jetpack Social connection would have to be owned by a different Facebook account. Head to Facebook and log out of your account Log back in with another Facebook account which is listed as an administrator for the target Facebook page You should then be able to go back to Settings → Sharing in your dashboard and click Add a new Connection to create a new Jetpack Social connection Navigate to Jetpack → Settings → Sharing from your WordPress dashboard and click “Connect your social media accounts.” This takes you to the connections page in your WordPress. com dashboard. From here, you can click the downward arrow next to the Disconnect button for Facebook, which will open up a section with your current Facebook connections. To add a new connection, click Connect one more account Troubleshooting Jetpack Social Facebook Connections Before taking a look at the below issues and solutions, check that your Jetpack connection is working properly first – Jetpack Social will not work properly otherwise. I’ve connected Jetpack Social to Facebook, but my posts still do not appear on my page When Jetpack Social publishes a post to your Facebook page, Facebook crawls your post and looks for Open Graph meta tags in the head to build a complete Facebook post preview (with an image, title, description, etc.). If it detects an error in these Open Graph meta tags, Facebook rejects the published post. You can see what Facebook sees and check for errors by entering one of your post URLs in the Facebook Sharing Debugger. If the Facebook Sharing Debugger reports an error, you’ll need to fix it for Jetpack Social to start working again. A common error is a duplicate set of Open Graph meta tags, usually caused by plugins that offer the same functionality that Jetpack does. In such cases, the solution would be to make sure you only use one plugin to manage your Open Graph tags. Some themes also manage Open Graph meta tags for you. If that’s the case, you’ll need to edit the theme or contact the theme authors to ask them how to remove Open Graph metadata from your theme. Jetpack Social is still not working! If your Facebook account is showing as connected but posts are not being sent to Facebook even though their Sharing Debugger shows no issues, you may need to try disconnecting and then reconnecting Facebook as explained here. As a next step, it is possible that there may be another plugin on your site conflicting with Jetpack Social. Please try to disable all of your plugins except Jetpack, then try testing Jetpack Social again. If Jetpack Social works, you’ll know that another plugin is interfering here. You can find out which plugin is the culprit by enabling each plugin one by one and repeating the test after each one to reveal the culprit. If it is still not working after disabling your plugins, it may be the theme. To test this, you can switch to a more minimalist theme such as Twenty Twenty-One. If the issue is resolved then, you’ll know it’s a problem with the theme, and you’ll need to contact the theme author for further assistance. The Facebook page I want to connect to is not available to select This normally happens if you have previously connected another site to the same Facebook account, and restricted the pages that WordPress is allowed to manage. To fix this, you’ll need to completely disconnect your Facebook account, as described above, and when reconnecting, make sure to click the “Choose what you allow” link to allow WordPress to manage all pages (or at least all the pages that you may want to connect to in future).

If you select the Twitter Thread option, you’ll see vertical bars in the post editor, indicating where your content will be split into separate tweets. Content is automatically divided into separate Tweets, as indicated.

Any email service can be used to send email to this address, allowing you to quickly and easily publish from devices where the WordPress app may not be installed. You can enable the Post by Email feature from Jetpack → Dashboard → Settings → Writing → Post by email in your site’s WP Admin. Continue reading for more detail, or click on a section below to be taken directly to it. Creating an email address Sending emails, formatting emails, and removing signatures Adding attachments and using shortcodes Adding categories and tags Changing your Jetpack Social settings Inserting polls Delaying posts Providing post titles and changing post status Example email with shortcodes Can I use PHPMailer or another PHP script? Creating an Email Address Post by email requires an email address to post to, not from. This should be a secret address that only you know, otherwise, anyone who knows it can submit content to your site. Jetpack provides suggestions for a secret address under Jetpack → Dashboard → Settings → Writing → Post by email when clicking the ‘Create Address’ button: Jetpack will generate a random address like the one below. Do not use this address for your own site. Each click of the ‘Regenerate address’ button will generate a new random address. Once you see an address you like, leave it in place, and your site will be ready to receive posts by email. Sending Emails Publishing a post by email is straightforward. Please note that you can only post by email to one site at a time and the email address you send from must be the email address that is associated with the WordPress. com account connected to your website. When writing a new email the subject line will be used as your post’s title, and the email body will be used as the post’s content. If it’s not possible to provide a subject line a shortcode can be used instead (explained below). Mail Formatting Your email can be plain text or formatted. Be aware that the Post by Email system will strip any HTML tags that it thinks will interfere with a post’s display on your site. For example, italic and bold formatting will be retained, but colour and font changes will not. Note: when posting by email you will need to use an email client that supports rich text or HTML formatting in order to make use of formatting. Most website based clients support this, as do most desktop clients. Keep in mind that you may need to switch your client into rich text or formatted mode. Signatures When posting by email, signatures that match the standard signature block pattern will be automatically removed: -- (that is, dash dash space) Posting by email will also remove anything after a <hr/> HTML tag, and will attempt to clean up cellphone network signatures as well. If your email system attaches a signature that does not match any of these patterns then you can manually tell Post by Email to stop including the signature by adding a special [end] shortcode on its own line, with a blank line above it. Content after this shortcode will be removed from your post. Alternatively, if your cellphone network is adding a signature and you want us to remove it, then let us know the details and we’ll be happy to take a look. Attachments Post by Email supports sending PDF files and images as attachments. PDF attachments sent using Post by Email will appear at the bottom of your post, accessible by a link. Image attachments will be included in your post as follows: Single images will be displayed inline (a single image is defined as an image without another image immediately following it). Multiple images will be displayed as a gallery. Multiple galleries and single images are allowed in the same post. You can use the [nogallery] shortcode to disable all galleries in a post. Shortcodes Shortcodes can be embedded in your email to configure various aspects of the published post. The following shortcodes can be used when posting by email: [category x,y,z] [excerpt]some excerpt[/excerpt] [tags x,y,z] [delay +1 hour] [comments on | off] [status publish | pending | draft | private] [slug some-url-name] [title Your post title] [end] – everything after this shortcode is ignored (e. g. signatures). If you use this, make sure it’s on its own line with a blank line above it. [slideshow] – replaces the auto-gallery with a slideshow [nogallery] – disables the auto-gallery and displays all images inline [more] – see more tag [nextpage] – see pagination [publicize off|yahoo|twitter|facebook] – change Jetpack Social options (see below) Shortcodes can be included anywhere in the body of your email and must be in lowercase. There should be no spaces between the left square bracket and the shortcode content. Adding Categories The category shortcode allows you to add existing categories to your post, or create new categories. Categories must be comma separated. [category holidays, main-dishes] Note: it’s possible to add categories by matching existing category slugs. For example, ‘main-dishes’ may add the ‘Main Dishes’ category if it exists. If the ‘main-dishes’ category did not exist, however, then a new category with the slug and name ‘main-dishes’ would be created instead. Adding Tags As with categories, any number of tags can be added to your post, each separated by a comma. You can add existing tags, or create new ones. [tags one potato, two potato, three potato, more] In this example, four tags will be added to your post: ‘one potato’, ‘two potato’, ‘three potato’, and ‘more’. Changing a Post’s Jetpack Social settings Jetpack’s Jetpack Social feature lets you notify other web services about your posts. With the [publicize] shortcode you can control this from Post by Email. Note: your Jetpack Social settings must have been previously configured for these shortcodes to work. Importantly, if you have already configured Jetpack Social and don’t include these shortcodes in your post, then it will be shared to all of your connected Jetpack Social accounts. The following Jetpack Social shortcodes are available: [publicize off] – disable all Jetpack Social notifications. [publicize twitter] – only send a notification to Twitter. [publicize twitter]my new post[/publicize] – only send a notification to Twitter and set the Twitter status to my new post. [publicize twitter facebook] – Sends a notification Facebook and Twitter only. Note: if you use more than one [publicize] shortcode in your post (for example, both [publicize twitter] and [publicize facebook]), only the second shortcode will be used (in this case, [publicize facebook]). If you want to share to only these two services, you need to use a combined shortcode, like [publicize twitter facebook]. Delaying Your Post The delay shortcode will accept any time allowed by PHP’s strtotime function. For example, you can use the following to delay your post by one hour, or two days, respectively. [delay +1 hour] [delay +2 days] Providing a post title By default, the title of your post will be taken from the subject line of your email. In some instances, such as when sending an email from some cell phones or via a MMS-Email gateway, you may not be able to provide a subject. In these cases, you can set your post title from inside the email with a shortcode: [title My Fancy Post] This will set the title of your post to ‘My Fancy Post’. Changing Your Post Status Sometimes you may want your post to be private, or to be reviewed by yourself or someone else before being published. To do this, you can use the [status] shortcode to set the post status. [status private] This will post your content with a ‘private’ status. Example Email with Shortcodes The following email will be published in two days’ time to the “WordPress” category, with the tags “announcement” and “WordPress”: Welcome to Post by Email, the easiest way to blog! [tags announcement, WordPress] [category WordPress] [delay +2 days] Can I use PHPMailer or another PHP script? No. Our anti-spam controls will always block posts from PHP scripts, including PHPMailer. The post by email feature is only available for email clients. Privacy Information This feature is de-activated by default. It can be activated any time by toggling the Publish posts by sending an email in the Post by email section from Jetpack — Settings — Writing in your dashboard. Data Used Site Owners / Users This feature utilizes the local ID of the user configuring or publishing via this feature.

For general features and FAQs, please see our information page. Sharing gives readers the tools to post your content to their networks from the bottom of each post and/or page. You can configure services to appear as icons, text, or both. Some services also display the number of times the post has been shared, as reported by that service. Activating Sharing Buttons To activate the Sharing buttons: In the WP Admin, go to Jetpack → Settings → Sharing. Under Sharing buttons, activate the Add sharing buttons to your posts and pages option. Adding and Configuring Sharing Buttons Once the feature is active you can add sharing buttons to your site in four short steps: Navigate to Settings → Sharing in your site’s WP Admin * or you can paste the following URL beside your domain: yoursite. com/wp-admin/options-general. php?page=sharing Under Sharing Buttons, drag and drop the services you want to use into the Enabled Services area in any order you wish. You can also drag services into a box in the Enabled Services area that will hide those services behind a share button. Choose your preferred button style and where you would like the buttons to appear. Click Save Changes. * Sharing buttons can also be managed in WordPress. com via Tools → Marketing → Sharing Buttons. To add new services, drag the button into the Enabled Services area at any time. Sharing Button Options There are a few options that you can customize on your sharing buttons: Button Style: This option allows you to choose to display buttons with the Icon + Text, Icon Only, Text Only, or the service’s official sharing button. Sharing Label: This option allows you to customize the message that shows above your sharing buttons. Show buttons on: This option allows you to choose to show sharing buttons on the Front Page, Archive Pages, and Search Results, Posts, Pages, and/or Media. Twitter Site Tag: Adding your Twitter username in this field will add a custom via @TwitterUsername message on the end of the shared tweet. Disable CSS and JS: Advanced. If this option is checked, you must include these files in your theme manually for the sharing links to work. Supported Services The following services are currently supported: Email* Facebook LinkedIn Mastodon Tumblr Twitter WhatsApp Pinterest Pocket Print Reddit Skype Telegram * Please Note: Email sharing is only available if you are using the Akismet spam filtering plugin to prevent spam abuse or if you explicitly enable it by adding the following to your functions. php file or a functionality plugin: add_filter( 'sharing_services_email', '__return_true' ); Troubleshooting The buttons don’t show the number of shares/likes Not all services allow share counts to be displayed. Twitter will not show the number of shares. Facebook Share numbers are a total of shares, likes, and comments on Facebook. Share counts are only displayed on the “official buttons” for certain services. Try selecting official buttons from the Button Style dropdown if the number of shares does not display. Pinterest’s Pin-It Button will only show on images if you are using the Official Buttons style. The Sharing buttons are not displaying Check your Sharing settings at Settings → Sharing and make sure you have enabled the sharing buttons on the post types you want to display them on: The share counts have been reset to zero The totals shown for each official sharing button are reported from the services themselves: Facebook, Twitter etc. To calculate the total count, those services use the exact URL of the post when it was originally shared. If your site’s url changes in any way (for example, changing from http to https, or changing the permalink structure), since the exact URL of the posts has now changed, the counts will have been reset to zero. And since the count data lies with each service and not on WordPress. com or with Jetpack, there’s no way for us to merge or update those totals on our end. I don’t see a Sharing section in my WordPress. com dashboard When Sharing is activated, you should find a Sharing Buttons section in your WordPress. com dashboard, under Tools → Marketing. If you don’t see it, please follow this guide to make sure the Sharing feature is not disabled. Why can’t I share to Google+? Google+ is now no longer a sharing button option. If you had not added a Google+ button to your site before, you won’t see the option to add one to your site anymore. Under Settings > Sharing, you will not see any Google+ option. If you had added a Google+ button to your site in the past, you will see a new button instead, when you are logged in to your admin account. That button will invite you to remove that deprecated service from your site. Your readers, however, won’t see anything. Customization How do I create my own custom sharing buttons? Navigate to Settings → Sharing on your WP Admin dashboard. Click the Add a new service link in the Available Services section. Enter a “Service name” to use for the sharing service. It will appear in the link to the service and in the blog sharing stats. Enter the “Sharing URL.” This is the URL address to the sharing service. You can use the variables,%post_title% %post_url% (short URL), %post_full_url% and %post_excerpt% in the URL, i. e. http://www. google. com/buzz/post?url=%post_url%Enter the “Icon URL.” This is the URL address to the icon image you wish to use to display with this service, i. e. https://www. someserver. com/images/buzz. png. Note that this image should be available online at the link that you enter here. Click the “Create Share Button” button. The new service will appear in the Available Services section. You can now add it to the Enabled Services section to use on your site. As you customize the sharing services, you can see how they are ordered in the Live Preview section. How do I add a Captcha to the Email sharing button? The Email button is great, and you can make it even better by adding a Captcha to the submission form: To add the Captcha to your site, follow these steps: Register for an account on this site. Upon registration, you will receive a Public and a Private key. Open your site’s wp-config. php file in your favorite text editor. Add the following constants with both reCaptcha keys right before /* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */: define( 'RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY', 'XXXXXXX' ); define( 'RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY', 'XXXXXXX' ); Save the wp-config. php file and refresh your site. Voila! Your email sharing buttons are now protected against spam. How can I move where the sharing icons are displayed? By default, the sharing icons will display right at the bottom of your post’s content. You may want to move it elsewhere in your post, such as right before the content. To do this, in your functions. php file, add the following: function jptweak_remove_share() { remove_filter( 'the_content', 'sharing_display', 19 ); remove_filter( 'the_excerpt', 'sharing_display', 19 ); if ( class_exists( 'Jetpack_Likes' ) ) { remove_filter( 'the_content', array( Jetpack_Likes::init(), 'post_likes' ), 30, 1 ); } } add_action( 'loop_start', 'jptweak_remove_share' ); Then find the file for the location where you’d like the sharing icons to appear. Insert the following code in the area you want the Sharing or Likes buttons to appear: if ( function_exists( 'sharing_display' ) ) { sharing_display( '', true ); } if ( class_exists( 'Jetpack_Likes' ) ) { $custom_likes = new Jetpack_Likes; echo $custom_likes-&amp;gt;post_likes( '' ); } add_action( 'loop_start', 'jptweak_remove_share' ); Please note that this is provided as a courtesy and we do not provide support for implementing or editing custom code. How can I hide the sharing buttons on mobile? Insert this code in your functions. php file: // Check if we are on mobile function jetpack_developer_is_mobile() { // Are Jetpack Mobile functions available? if ( ! function_exists( 'jetpack_is_mobile' ) ) { return false; } // Is Mobile theme showing? if ( isset( $_COOKIE['akm_mobile'] ) &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; $_COOKIE['akm_mobile'] == 'false' ) { return false; } return jetpack_is_mobile(); } // Let's remove the sharing buttons when on mobile function jetpack_developer_maybe_add_filter() { // On mobile? if ( jetpack_developer_is_mobile() ) { add_filter( 'sharing_show', '__return_false' ); } } add_action( 'wp_head', 'jetpack_developer_maybe_add_filter' ); add_action( 'loop_start', 'jptweak_remove_share' ); How do I use my own resources instead of Jetpack’s default sharing CSS and JS files? The sharing feature includes an “advanced” option, allowing you to use your own Javascript and CSS files instead of the files added by Jetpack by default. To get started, go to Settings → Sharing in your dashboard, and check the Advanced checkbox at the bottom of the page. Then, you can add your own libraries by adding the following code in a functionality plugin or in your theme’s functions. php file: function tweakjp_add_sharing_js() { wp_enqueue_script( 'sharing-js', WP_SHARING_PLUGIN_URL . 'sharing. js', array( ), 4 ); $sharing_js_options = array( 'lang' =&amp;amp;gt; get_base_recaptcha_lang_code(), 'counts' =&amp;amp;gt; apply_filters( 'jetpack_sharing_counts', true ) ); wp_localize_script( 'sharing-js', 'sharing_js_options', $sharing_js_options ); } add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'tweakjp_add_sharing_js' ); function tweakjp_add_sharing_css() { wp_enqueue_style( 'sharing', WP_SHARING_PLUGIN_URL. 'sharing. css', false, JETPACK__VERSION ); } add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'tweakjp_add_sharing_css' ); How do I add “via @username” to the tweets sent via the Twitter button? There are 2 options to add your Twitter account to the end of each tweet: You can fill in the “Twitter Site Tag” option in Settings → Sharing. If you use Jetpack Social and connected a Twitter account, this account will be used in the Twitter sharing button. Privacy Information This feature is de-activated by default. It can be activated at any time by toggling the Add sharing buttons to your posts and pages setting in the Sharing buttons section from Jetpack → Settings → Sharing in your dashboard. Data Used Site Owners / Users If you add your Twitter username to the Sharing settings, it will be published with the tweet sharing your content. The post title and permalink will also be shared with any of the services. Moreover, if you have Akismet enabled on your site, and a visitor attempts to share a post via email, the site’s home page URL and the post’s permalink will be sent in the API call to Akismet in order to check for spam. Additionally, for activity tracking (detailed below): IP address, WordPress. com user ID, WordPress. com username, WordPress. com-connected site ID and URL, Jetpack version, user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. Site Visitors When official sharing buttons are active on the site, each button loads content directly from its service in order to display the button as well as information and tools for the sharing party. As a result, each service can in turn collect information about the sharing party. When a non-official Facebook or a Pinterest sharing button is active on the site, information such as the sharing party’s IP address as well as the page URL will be available for each service, so sharing counts can be displayed next to the button. When sharing content via email (this option is only available if Akismet is active on the site), the following information is used: sharing party’s name and email address (if the user is logged in, this information will be pulled directly from their account), IP address (for spam checking), user agent (for spam checking), and email body/content. This content will be sent to Akismet (also owned by Automattic) so that a spam check can be performed. Additionally, if reCAPTCHA (by Google) is enabled by the site owner, the sharing party’s IP address will be shared with that service. You can find Google’s privacy policy here. Activity Tracked Site Owners / Users We track when, and by which user, the feature is activated and deactivated. We track when, and which, configuration settings are modified (and by which user).

Note: The steps above will also adjust your site’s RSS feed. If you prefer, you can split the content of each one of your blog posts into two parts thanks to the More tag. Everything that is above the More tag will appear on your home page and in the subscription emails, followed by a link inviting users to click to continue reading. Everything that is below that tag will only appear on the post’s page. Why does my username display in the subscription emails? When you publish a new post, the subscription email includes a “by [author]” section below the post title. This uses the public display name settings from your site, which defaults to your username if you haven’t entered your real name. To change this, go to Users → My Profile and enter a first and last name, then you can change the Display name publicly as setting, to display a variation of your name instead of your username. Can I disable Subscriptions entirely? If you don’t want to use Subscriptions, you can follow the instructions here to disable it. Can I see who my subscribers are? Sure! Here’s how to find them: Go to your Dashboard. Click on Jetpack → Settings → Discussion. Scroll down to the “Subscriptions” section. Click on the link to “View your email followers.” Why is my subscriber count higher than expected? If you’ve connected your site to any social networks using Jetpack Social, we add your followers from those into your subscriber count. This is because, when you publish a new post, your social media followers will see an update about the new content, just like your email followers will. Why can’t I see all my email subscribers? The Email Subscribers tab currently only shows email subscribers who do not have a WordPress. com account. Your followers should still be receiving your email updates if they are shown in the main Followers list: http://wordpress. com/people/followers How can I transfer my followers from WordPress. com to Jetpack? If you’ve moved from WordPress. com to your very own Jetpack-powered site and want to transfer your WordPress. com followers and email subscribers, please use our transfer tool. Is there any limit to the number of subscribers I can have? No, there is no limit. Troubleshooting Are you experiencing any issues with this feature? If so, here are a few key steps that can help you solve the problem. Emails going to spam. Some email providers sometimes mark the emails coming from `*wordpress. com` as spam for security reasons. This means that the email might have gone to the junk or spam folder. Action to take: check the spam/junk folder to see if the emails have landed there. If that doesn’t help, reach out to the email provider and ask them to whitelist emails coming from `*wordpress. com`. Confirmation link has expired. Once a user subscribes to a site/blog they receive a confirmation email with a link to click in order to verify their subscription. This link lasts only 24 hours for security reasons. Action to take: try subscribing to the site again. If you still don’t receive the confirmation email, check your spam/junk folder. If there’s nothing in there, head to https://subscribe. wordpress. com/. Click on ‘Request Details’ and then click on the link in the email that you will receive. This will take you to a page where you can manage your subscriptions. Check in the Pending tab if there’s anything you need to confirm, cancel or approve. Check your plugins. It’s possible that there might be another plugin active in your site that’s clashing with Jetpack’s subscription feature. Action to take: if that’s so, try temporarily deactivating all your plugins, and then try sending another post to see if the subscriptions are sent. If it works, then reactivate each plugin one-by-one to find out which one is causing problems. Once you find it out, you can deactivate that if it’s not very much useful for you. It’s also worth reporting the plugin conflict to the plugin author(s) and to us too. There’s a partial list of plugins that may conflict with Jetpack at this page. Check your post content. If your posts have no content, Jetpack will not send new post email notifications to your subscribers. Action to take: make sure your post content is not empty. If page builders on your site use custom fields rather than the default WordPress post content field, Jetpack will not send emails also. The subscription feature doesn’t work at all and I can’t figure out what’s broken. If your posts have no content, Jetpack will not send new post email notifications to your subscribers. If you can’t pinpoint the root of the issue that’s preventing Subscriptions from working properly and showing as expected, chances are your Jetpack connection isn’t working properly either. There are steps outlined on this page that you can follow to check and debug your Jetpack connection. In case the Jetpack debugger is still showing a connection error, you can directly contact our support. I’ve lost all my followers! If you suddenly see that all your followers are disappeared into thin air, don’t lose your heart! All your data is stored in our WordPress. com servers, so it’s unlikely that you’ve lost all your followers. Chances are you’re running into an Identity Crisis issue. We can recover your temporary lost followers for you: just contact us and let us know what happened to you and your followers. We’ll be happy to fix that for you! Why are my shortcodes not rendering correctly? Jetpack Subscriptions supports a subset of the most popular shortcodes used in subscription emails. If you’re using a shortcode that WordPress. com and Jetpack Subscriptions does not support, then the shortcode will display in plain text. If you do not like how shortcodes are handled in subscription emails, then you can follow the instructions to customize the content that is sent out.

You’ll see a progress bar where you can pause and resume the upload, and you’ll be able to edit your Video Title and Thumbnail for your video as your video uploads. See our article on Uploading a Video to Jetpack VideoPress for recommendations on file size and format for your videos. Media Library allows you to select any VideoPress file that’s already been uploaded to your library. Insert from URL allows you to insert the video URL directly. Once the video successfully uploads, you’ll see the ‘Upload complete!’ notification. When you are settled with your Video Title and Thumbnail, click Done and you’ll see your video embedded into your post or page. From there, you’ll be able to set a caption for your video and access the Block Toolbar. Block Toolbar The VideoPress block toolbar allows you to change the video’s alignment on the page, change the video’s poster image, and add text tracks. Change Alignment By clicking the Change alignment button, you can change the video’s alignment to Align left, Align center, Align right, Wide width, or Full width. Edit Poster Image Clicking the poster image button will allow you to change the poster image for the video. This is the image that will be displayed before a video is played. This can be useful if the first frame of the video isn’t necessarily appealing or indicative of the video content. While there isn’t a minimum required size for your poster image, we recommend that the image be at least the size of your video. For example, if your video is a 1080p video, you should use an image that is 1920 by 1080 pixels. Adding Subtitles or Captions within a Video You can add subtitles or captions within your video by using a . vtt file. After adding your video using the VideoPress block, click on the Text Tracks icon, as shown below: You can then press Upload Track to upload your . vtt file. The Label and Source Language fields will automatically be populated if nothing is inserted. Click Save and your track will be added to the video. When you preview your post or page, you will see the subtitles menu that will be available in the video player, with your text track available as an option for a viewer to select. Note that viewers can use the Captions Settings menu in the VideoPress player to customize the appearance of the subtitles or captions text to their liking. Block Settings Every block has options available in the editor sidebar. If you do not see the sidebar, click the ‘cog’ icon next to the Publish button, and it will appear. The block settings can be found in the sidebar. Title and Description Here, you can add a title and description for your video, which is helpful for SEO and accessibility purposes. The Description box can also be used to add chapters to your video. Chapters are a great way to split up longer videos and organize them into different sections. They allow your visitors to see what each section is about and skip to their favorite parts. How to add Chapters to your VideoPress videos In the Description box, add a list of timestamps and titles. Make sure that the first timestamp starts with 00:00. Add at least three chapters entries. Add your chapters entries in consecutive order, with at least 10-second intervals between each. An example of correctly formatted video chapters. Playback Settings This section of the sidebar lets you control several settings: Autoplay: This option lets you set your video to automatically play when someone visits your page or post. Some browsers do not respect this setting. You may need to enable mute for autoplay to work in those instances. Loop: This option allows you to choose if the video repeats automatically after it plays through. Muted: This option allows you to choose if the video has sound when it plays. Users can still unmute the video from the player controls. It’s recommended to use the muted option if you choose to have your video autoplay. Show Controls: This option allows you to show or hide the playback controls on the video. This option is turned on by default. Play Inline: This option allows ​​your video to be played inline within the element’s playback area. However, not selecting this option doesn’t mean that your video will always be played fullscreen. VideoPress Progress Bar Colors You can use the Color settings to control the color of the progress bar in the VideoPress player. VideoPress will automatically default to the Match Video setting, which will allow the progress bar to adapt to the video as it plays. If you toggle off Match Video, you’ll be presented with three color sections to change: Main, Loaded, and Progress. After you select your desired Progress Bar colors, be sure to click Save Colors. Now, you’ll be able to see and customize your selected colors while previewing them in the player. When you update your page or post, these color changes will be live on your selected video. Privacy and Rating These settings allow you to control the video privacy, the video rating, and whether the VideoPress player should include the option to download the video. Rating: Allows you to select a rating for the video, based on its content. Privacy: This setting allows you to change whether or not the video is considered Private, for site members only, or Public, for all visitors to your site. For more information, check out our VideoPress: Privacy article. Allow Download: This allows you to control whether the VideoPress player should include the option for users to download the video. Advanced The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit. Please note that the video player is embedded in an iframe, meaning it’s not possible to style the video player with CSS. Only the <div> which contains the video player can be styled with CSS. You can also add an HTML anchor to the block, which lets you link directly to that section of the page. Video Stats An overview of the overall video stats can be found within your Jetpack Stats. You can scroll down and find the “Videos” stats: Clicking on “Video” will take you to the page that shows more statistics: Impressions: The number of times a video was loaded on the page. Hours watched: The total number of hours that the video has been watched by all viewers. Views: The total number of how many times the video was played.

The content is intended to be displayed on a blog’s front page; by using the feature consistently in this manner, users are given a reliable Featured Content experience on which they can rely even when switching themes. To get started you can follow these easy steps: Enable theme support for Featured Content. Go to Appearance → Customize, and set a tag under Tag Name in Featured Content. Tag some content. For more detailed information, read on! Or jump directly to usage tips, steps for adding support to your theme, and template tips. Usage Featured Content options as shown with Twenty Fourteen. If your theme supports Featured Content, you can activate the Featured Content area by navigating to Appearance → Customize and entering the name of a tag into the “Tag name” field in the “Featured Content” section. If you enter the name of a tag that does not exist already a new tag will be created for you. Once this value has been set, published posts tagged with this value will be included in the Featured Content Area. You can control the amount of featured posts by the amount of posts you tag with the above set featured content tag. By default, Featured Content will return a maximum of 15 posts; however, the theme itself may define its own maximum number of posts. This may be necessary if the theme uses large featured images in its Featured Content presentation, for example. “Hide tag from displaying in post meta and tag clouds” can be checked to ensure that the tag selected for Featured Content doesn’t show up in that post’s list of tags or the Tag Cloud widget. Your tag’s archive will continue to be displayed in normal fashion. The “Display tag content in all listings” option can be checked to ensure that the Featured Content tag will display in all pages and archives. Adding Support to a Theme The first step in adding Featured Content support to your theme is to call add_theme_support() passing 'featured-content' as the first parameter. This call to add_theme_support() should happen during the after_setup_theme action. add_theme_support( 'featured-content', array( 'filter' => 'mytheme_get_featured_posts', 'max_posts' => 20, 'post_types' => array( 'post', 'page' ), ) ); The second parameter, $args, is an array that may contain 3 separate values. The first is required and the 2 others are optional: filter – The name of a custom filter that is used to return featured content. This should be prefixed with the theme slug. max_posts – The maximum number of posts that may be contained in the area. It’s possible that a theme might only be able to fit six posts into the area. In cases like this, max_posts should be set to six. post_types – By default, the Featured Content feature will pull posts only. However, you can add Featured Content support for registered post types by defining an post_types argument (in the form of a string or an array). Getter Function A function should be created that returns the value of the filter defined in add_theme_support( 'featured-content' ). This will be used to assign featured posts to a variable in a template file. function mytheme_get_featured_posts() { return apply_filters( 'mytheme_get_featured_posts', array() ); } Conditional Function To avoid markup being printed and scripts being enqueued when they are not needed, we can define a function to help us make these decisions. This function should return a Boolean value and accept a single parameter. The parameter is used to declare the minimum number of featured posts required to return a true value. function mytheme_has_featured_posts( $minimum = 1 ) { if ( is_paged() ) return false; $minimum = absint( $minimum ); $featured_posts = apply_filters( 'mytheme_get_featured_posts', array() ); if ( ! is_array( $featured_posts ) ) return false; if ( $minimum > count( $featured_posts ) ) return false; return true; } For example, in the case of a slider, we can use mytheme_has_featured_posts() in different ways for adding markup and enqueuing scripts. As our slider only shows one post at a time, we may have markup we need to output as long as there is one featured post, but we’ll only need to enqueue our slider JavaScript if there are two or more posts. <!-- Found in our template file --> <?php if ( mytheme_has_featured_posts( 1 ) ) : ?> <div class=\"featured-content\"> <?php get_template_part( 'content-featured' ); ?> </div> <?php endif; ?> // In functions. php, in a function hooked to wp_enqueue_scripts if ( mytheme_has_featured_posts( 2 ) ) { wp_enqueue_script( 'mytheme-slider-script', get_template_directory_uri() . '/js/awesome-slider. js', array( 'jquery' ) ); } How can I add a “fallback” image? If no Featured Image is set for a post, Jetpack will look for slideshows, galleries, or single images you may have attached to or inserted into the post. However, if no image is associated with a post, no Featured Image will appear. If you want a “fallback” image to display in these instances, you can add this code snippet to your theme’s functions. php file: function jeherve_custom_image( $media, $post_id, $args ) { if ( $media ) { return $media; } else { $permalink = get_permalink( $post_id ); $url = apply_filters( 'jetpack_photon_url', 'YOUR_LOGO_IMG_URL' ); return array( array( 'type' => 'image', 'from' => 'custom_fallback', 'src' => esc_url( $url ), 'href' => $permalink, ) ); } } add_filter( 'jetpack_images_get_images', 'jeherve_custom_image', 10, 3 ); Templates To standardize the user experience across themes, we have developed the concept of a front page featured content area. This area will always display on the “front page” of a WordPress installation – in other words, this area will always be rendered when is_front_page() returns true. Depending on the theme’s design and the site’s settings, is_front_page() may return true in multiple different templates. The Featured Content area should be rendered in the following templates if present in a theme: Themes that include front-page. php The front-page. php template will always be used to render the frontpage if it exists in a theme. If your theme provides this template, it is the only one to which the featured content area needs to be added. Themes without front-page. php If front-page. php is not included in the theme, the Featured Content area should be added to the following templates if present: page. php home. php index. php All custom page templates.","length":6511,"tokens":1588,"chunks":[{"title":"Featured Content","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/featured-content/","content":"Featured Content Featured Content allows users to spotlight their posts and have them uniquely displayed by a theme.

To enable this feature, visit Jetpack → Settings → Writing in your site’s dashboard. Scroll down to the Theme Enhancements section and toggle on the Enhance CSS customization panel option. Starting with WordPress 4.7, you can now add custom CSS to your own theme directly from the Customizer. Just choose the Additional CSS tab when customizing your current theme to get started! Jetpack’s Custom CSS feature allows you to add more features to that CSS editor, as explained below. Adding Custom CSS First, access the CSS editor via Appearance → Customize → Additional CSS. If this is your first visit to the CSS Editor (or you have not yet added any custom CSS code), you will see a placeholder message in the editing window. Please review the message, as it contains some helpful tips to help you get started. When you’re ready to begin adding your custom CSS code, simply remove the message to get started or add your CSS after it. Editing Options You have a few options when editing your stylesheet, and these can be found directly below the editor: Preprocessor: the CSS editor has support for CSS preprocessors LESS and Sass (SCSS Syntax). This is an advanced option for users who wish to take advantage of CSS extensions like variables and mixins. See the LESS and Sass websites for more information. Add-on: when making changes to your site’s design, you’ll be adding your customizations on top of the existing theme stylesheet by default. You can, however, choose to replace the existing theme’s stylesheet with your own CSS thanks to the Start Fresh option. This second option should be used if you want to start with only the theme’s HTML structure and recreate all of its CSS from scratch. Refer to the theme’s original stylesheet for reference, and make sure you have all rules/styles accounted for. If you are missing certain elements, the public view of the blog may appear skewed. Only the CSS code in the editing window will be applied to your blog with this option. Media width: this option should be used if you have modified the width of the primary content area using custom CSS. The “Media Width” setting is used as the default size for full-size images when they are inserted into your blog. Note that it will not affect the size of some images you added before changing the setting, depending on how they were inserted, and you may have to re-insert some of them after changing the setting. Previewing and Saving When editing your CSS, you’ll be able to preview your changes before actually saving them – regardless of your skill level. If you like what you see and wish to save the changes, click the Save and Publish button at the top of the customizer window. CSS History CSS Revisions show prior versions of your custom CSS. Each time you save your changes, a revision is saved. Jetpack will store the last 25 CSS revisions made to any theme on your blog. To view these revisions, you can click See Full History at the bottom of the Additional CSS window in the Customizer. That will open the full custom CSS revisions history for the selected theme. To compare CSS Revisions, select a revision date using the slider at the top of the Revisions screen. The revision you selected will be shown side-by-side with the current version highlighting the differences between the two. A red highlight indicates something was removed while a green highlight indicates something that was added. To restore a previous version of your custom CSS, click Restore for that date and the custom CSS is reverted back. Notes Jetpack will include the custom CSS as an in-line stylesheet inside the document by default.

If you’ve recently edited that file, you’ll want to make sure the wp_footer() function is still there.

Jetpack, like other contact form plugins, uses wp_mail() to send out emails. It’s the same function WordPress uses to send you to comment notifications or notifications about new users registering on your site. You can check if that function works properly by leaving a comment on your site and checking if you receive an email. Another alternative would be to use the Email Logs plugin. This plugin records a log of all e-mails sent out by WordPress once it is activated.

Unlike many of the features in Jetpack, Infinite Scroll only works with themes that support it. Since each theme is constructed a bit differently, the Infinite Scroll feature needs information about the theme to function properly. NOTE: Most themes nowadays have Infinite Scroll support built in already! To check to see if your theme supports Infinite Scroll, go to Jetpack → Settings → Writing in your site’s Dashboard and look under the “Theme enhancements” section. Infinite Scroll supported by the theme If your theme does not have Infinite Scroll support built in, read on for detailed instructions on adding support to your theme, plus using CSS to customize the look. Infinite Scroll not supported by the theme Adding Support Jetpack Infinite Scroll is not supported for block themes. For classic (non-block) themes, enabling Infinite Scroll is very similar to adding support for post thumbnails or editor styles, since we make use of add_theme_support(). By providing a few key pieces of information when calling add_theme_support(), Infinite Scroll will seamlessly integrate with your theme. Here is how it’s done for the Twenty Twelve default WordPress theme: add_theme_support( 'infinite-scroll', array( 'container' => 'content', 'footer' => 'page', ) ); With that you get a fully functioning Infinite Scroll experience. container The container parameter is the core of adding Infinite Scroll to your theme: it specifies the ID of the HTML element to which Infinite Scroll should add additional posts to. The default value is content, but can be any valid CSS ID that appears in the supported theme and is appropriate for appending posts to. Usually, this’ll be the parent container of the posts in your theme. footer One of the issues with Infinite Scroll is that you can’t access the footer of a page, since whenever you approach the end, new posts are loaded. Our infinite scroll comes with a fixed footer that slides in once you scroll down the page. The footer parameter helps blend this footer with your theme design. By passing another ID, the infinite scroll footer will match its width so that it fits perfectly in your design. If you pass a false value instead, no new footer would be added. There are also other parameters you can tweak—here is an example showing all the default values for each configuration option: add_theme_support( 'infinite-scroll', array( 'type' => 'scroll', 'footer_widgets' => false, 'container' => 'content', 'wrapper' => true, 'render' => false, 'posts_per_page' => false, ) ); Breaking down each option: type type accepts two different values: scroll or click. This controls the default Infinite Scroll behaviour. scroll will cause posts to be loaded automatically when the visitor approaches the bottom of the current list of posts, while click shows a Load more posts button, letting the user control when more posts are loaded. scroll is the default, but if a theme has footer widgets, this could be overridden to click so the widgets are accessible. footer_widgets The footer_widgets argument accepts a variety of values and indicates whether or not a theme has footer widgets. If footer widgets are present, the scroll type will be set to click so the widgets are accessible. At its simplest, either a boolean true or false can be set if the footer should always or never be shown, respectively. Additionally, either a string representing a sidebar ID ('sidebar-1', for example), or an array of sidebar IDs will be accepted by the footer_widgets argument. The Infinite Scroll code will check if the sidebar(s) contain widgets and set the footer_widgets argument accordingly. Whenever possible, we highly recommend providing sidebar IDs if a theme places widget areas below the post list. Doing so provides the best experience for the theme’s users by dynamically determining whether the scroll type should be scroll or click. That said, if a theme specifies click as the type from the outset, then the footer_widgets argument can safely be omitted. If all of those options weren’t enough, the infinite_scroll_has_footer_widgets filter is available for advanced logic. The filter must return a boolean value, and could be used to detect the presence of nav menus, or a visitor using a mobile device. wrapper The wrapper argument behaves similarly to footer_widgets, in that it accepts a few different values. This argument determines whether or not each set of additional posts is contained within a div element when appended to the container specified in the preceeding argument. If a boolean value (true or false) is specified, either a div with the class infinite-wrap is placed around the additional posts, or it isn’t. To wrap the posts in a div with a custom class, set the wrapper argument to a string representing the custom class. Please note that the wrapper argument only accepts a single string with no whitespace. It is generally good practice to wrap the appended posts in a div, unless doing so will result in invalid markup. For example, if a theme uses a list element (ol, ul) to display posts, the wrapper should be disabled so that div elements don’t appear where they don’t belong. Render Infinite Scroll uses a standard WordPress loop to render the additional posts it appends, and utilizes template parts in the content-{post format}. php form. If a theme includes at least content. php, then the render argument can be omitted. Below is the default rendering function Infinite Scroll uses: while( have_posts() ) { the_post(); get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() ); } If greater customization is needed, or a theme doesn’t use the content template parts, a function name should be specified for the render argument and that function will be used to generate the markup for Infinite Scroll. The function must include the while() portion of WordPress’ loop and can utilize any function available to the theme when it renders posts. posts_per_page By default, the type argument controls how many posts are loaded each time Infinite Scroll acts. For the scroll type, seven (7) posts are loaded each time Infinite Scroll is activated. For the click type, a site’s “Blog pages show at most” value found under Settings → Reading is used. If, however, a theme’s layout expects a certain number of posts, the posts_per_page argument will override the defaults discussed in the preceding paragraph. This control is beneficial, for example, in a theme with a three-column layout where greater or fewer than three posts would result in an uneven layout. Examples With as wide a variety of themes and themers as exists, we aimed to provide enough control over how Infinite Scroll behaves as is necessary to support many themes. That said, our experience on WordPress. com showed that generally, each theme needs very few configuration options. To demonstrate, we’ve provided the Infinite Scroll configuration of WordPress default themes. Twenty Twelve /** * Add theme support for infinite scroll. * * @uses add_theme_support * @return void */ function twenty_twelve_infinite_scroll_init() { add_theme_support( 'infinite-scroll', array( 'container' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 'content', ) ); } add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'twenty_twelve_infinite_scroll_init' ); For those unfamiliar with the Twenty Twelve theme, it uses content-{post format}. php template parts and has no widget area below posts, so we’ve omitted the footer_widgets and render arguments. In reality, since the container value matches the default, that argument could be omitted as well; we’ve left it for clarity. Twenty Eleven /** * Add theme support for infinity scroll. */ function twenty_eleven_infinite_scroll_init() { add_theme_support( 'infinite-scroll', array( 'container' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 'content', 'footer_widgets' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; array( 'sidebar-3', 'sidebar-4', 'sidebar-5', ), 'footer' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 'page', ) ); } add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'twenty_eleven_infinite_scroll_init' ); Twenty Eleven comes with footer widget areas, which wouldn’t be reachable when you scroll down as new posts would be added whenever you reached the bottom. To solve this, we pass an array with the IDs of those widget areas to footer_widgets. Now, if one of those sidebars has a widget, our Infinite Scroll plugin will detect it, and switch to the click type automatically (where you click to load more posts on demand), so your footer content is still perfectly accessible. If your theme has footer widgets, consider this approach as you greatly improve the experience of your users. Twenty Ten /** * Add theme support for infinity scroll */ function twenty_ten_infinite_scroll_init() { add_theme_support( 'infinite-scroll', array( 'container' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 'content', 'render' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 'twenty_ten_infinite_scroll_render', 'footer' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 'wrapper', ) ); } add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'twenty_ten_infinite_scroll_init' ); /** * Set the code to be rendered on for calling posts, * hooked to template parts when possible. * * Note: must define a loop. * function twenty_ten_infinite_scroll_render() { get_template_part( 'loop' ); } Twenty Ten uses a slightly different template structure to render posts, so we need to provide a custom render function to infinite scroll. Do It With Style The last missing piece is how to make Infinite Scroll blend perfectly with your site design. Infinite Scroll relies on the theme supporting body_class, and it provides theme developers with the utmost flexibility to improve the experience by using some specific body classes: whenever Infinite Scroll is active there will be an infinite-scroll class available on body; if the Infinite Scroll type is “scroll”, there will also be a neverending class too. Once the last post in a blog has been loaded, there will be an infinity-end class added. With these, you can hide your regular footer and navigation links, and show them again when Infinite Scroll is finished. Example: /* Hides navigation links and site footer when infinite scroll is active */ . infinite-scroll #navigation, . infinite-scroll. neverending #footer { display: none; } /* Shows the footer again in case all posts have been loaded */ . infinity-end. neverending #footer { display: block; } There are also two elements that you’ll want to style so that they fit in with your theme: span. infinite-loader is the loading indicator that is displayed while new posts are being retrieved. It is inserted as a child of container, and it is possible that after it is no longer needed, it will be hidden rather than removed from the DOM. Ensure that your CSS handles both cases. div#infinite-handle is the Load more posts button shown for type=click. You can ignore this if your theme will always use type=scroll and will never have any footer widgets. JavaScript Events Inevitably, there are situations in a theme that require some JavaScript interaction after posts are added. One such example is in a theme that uses jQuery Masonry and needs to trigger that library to position the additional posts. Recognizing this need, we trigger an event after posts are appended. To make use of this event, simply catch the post-load event when it fires on document. body: ( function( $ ) { $( document. body ). on( 'post-load', function () { // New posts have been added to the page. } ); } )( jQuery ); Add custom arguments to the Infinite Scroll query Some themes and plugins add extra arguments to post queries, often to change the way the posts are sorted or loaded. You can use the infinite_scroll_query_args filter to add those extra arguments to Infinite Scroll as well. In the example below, we’ll add 2 custom ordering parameters, order and orderby: /** * Sort all Infinite Scroll results alphabetically by post name * * @param array $args * @filter infinite_scroll_query_args * @return array */ function jetpack_infinite_scroll_query_args( $args ) { $args['order'] = 'ASC'; $args['orderby'] = 'name'; return $args; } add_filter( 'infinite_scroll_query_args', 'jetpack_infinite_scroll_query_args' ); Troubleshooting I have Infinite Scroll set to Load more posts as the reader scrolls down, but instead it shows an “Older Posts” button. Does your theme have footer widgets? If you have any widgets in the footer widget area, Infinite Scroll will switch to using the “Older Posts” button automatically, to ensure that the footer widgets can be viewed on your site. If you want posts to load as you scroll down, you can place widgets in an alternative widget area, such as the sidebar. If your theme has only footer widget areas, you may wish to look for a different theme with more widget area options. Other notes Recognizing that this feature requires theme support to be useful, we’ve bundled support into Jetpack for the default WordPress themes prior to the Twenty Twenty-Two theme. (Twenty Twenty-Two and Twenty Twenty-Three are default WordPress themes as well, but they are block themes, which are not compatible with Infinite Scroll.) If you are using an Infinite Scroll-compatible default theme, you can enable the Infinite Scroll and enjoy this feature immediately.

Unlike many of the features in Jetpack, Infinite Scroll only works with themes that support it. Since each theme is constructed a bit differently, the Infinite Scroll feature needs information about the theme to function properly. NOTE: Most themes nowadays have Infinite Scroll support built in already! To check to see if your theme supports Infinite Scroll, go to Jetpack → Settings → Writing in your site’s Dashboard and look under the “Theme enhancements” section. Infinite Scroll supported by the theme If your theme does not have Infinite Scroll support built in, read on for detailed instructions on adding support to your theme, plus using CSS to customize the look.

","length":991,"tokens":190},{"title":"Infinite Scroll","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/infinite-scroll/","content":"For classic (non-block) themes, enabling Infinite Scroll is very similar to adding support for post thumbnails or editor styles, since we make use of add_theme_support() By providing a few key pieces of information when calling add_theme_support(), Infinite Scroll will seamlessly integrate with your theme. Here is how it’s done for the Twenty Twelve default WordPress theme: add_theme_support( 'infinite-scroll', array( 'container' => 'content', 'footer' => 'page', ) ); With that you get a fully functioning Infinite Scroll experience. container The container parameter is the core of adding Infinite Scroll to your theme: it specifies the ID of the HTML element to which Infinite Scroll should add additional posts to. The default value is content, but can be any valid CSS ID that appears in the supported theme and is appropriate for appending posts to. Usually, this’ll be the parent container of the posts in your theme. ","length":929,"tokens":199},{"title":"Infinite Scroll","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/infinite-scroll/","content":"footer One of the issues with Infinite Scroll is that you can’t access the footer of a page, since whenever you approach the end, new posts are loaded. Our infinite scroll comes with a fixed footer that slides in once you scroll down the page. The footer parameter helps blend this footer with your theme design. By passing another ID, the infinite scroll footer will match its width so that it fits perfectly in your design. If you pass a false value instead, no new footer would be added. ","length":491,"tokens":109},{"title":"Infinite Scroll","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/infinite-scroll/","content":"There are also other parameters you can tweak—here is an example showing all the default values for each configuration option: add_theme_support( 'infinite-scroll', array( 'type' => 'scroll', 'footer_widgets' => false, 'container' => 'content', 'wrapper' => true, 'render' => false, 'posts_per_page' => false, ) ); Breaking down each option: type type accepts two different values: scroll or click. This controls the default Infinite Scroll behaviour. scroll will cause posts to be loaded automatically when the visitor approaches the bottom of the current list of posts, while click shows a Load more posts button, letting the user control when more posts are loaded. scroll is the default, but if a theme has footer widgets, this could be overridden to click so the widgets are accessible. ","length":792,"tokens":177},{"title":"Infinite Scroll","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/infinite-scroll/","content":"footer_widgets The footer_widgets argument accepts a variety of values and indicates whether or not a theme has footer widgets. If footer widgets are present, the scroll type will be set to click so the widgets are accessible. At its simplest, either a boolean true or false can be set if the footer should always or never be shown, respectively. Additionally, either a string representing a sidebar ID ('sidebar-1', for example), or an array of sidebar IDs will be accepted by the footer_widgets argument. The Infinite Scroll code will check if the sidebar(s) contain widgets and set the footer_widgets argument accordingly. Whenever possible, we highly recommend providing sidebar IDs if a theme places widget areas below the post list. Doing so provides the best experience for the theme’s users by dynamically determining whether the scroll type should be scroll or click. ","length":877,"tokens":184},{"title":"Infinite Scroll","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/infinite-scroll/","content":"That said, if a theme specifies click as the type from the outset, then the footer_widgets argument can safely be omitted. If all of those options weren’t enough, the infinite_scroll_has_footer_widgets filter is available for advanced logic. The filter must return a boolean value, and could be used to detect the presence of nav menus, or a visitor using a mobile device. wrapper The wrapper argument behaves similarly to footer_widgets, in that it accepts a few different values. This argument determines whether or not each set of additional posts is contained within a div element when appended to the container specified in the preceeding argument. If a boolean value (true or false) is specified, either a div with the class infinite-wrap is placed around the additional posts, or it isn’t. To wrap the posts in a div with a custom class, set the wrapper argument to a string representing the custom class. ","length":913,"tokens":199},{"title":"Infinite Scroll","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/infinite-scroll/","content":"Please note that the wrapper argument only accepts a single string with no whitespace. It is generally good practice to wrap the appended posts in a div, unless doing so will result in invalid markup. For example, if a theme uses a list element (ol, ul) to display posts, the wrapper should be disabled so that div elements don’t appear where they don’t belong. Render Infinite Scroll uses a standard WordPress loop to render the additional posts it appends, and utilizes template parts in the content-{post format} php form. If a theme includes at least content. php, then the render argument can be omitted. ","length":610,"tokens":132},{"title":"Infinite Scroll","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/infinite-scroll/","content":"Below is the default rendering function Infinite Scroll uses: while( have_posts() ) { the_post(); get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() ); } If greater customization is needed, or a theme doesn’t use the content template parts, a function name should be specified for the render argument and that function will be used to generate the markup for Infinite Scroll. The function must include the while() portion of WordPress’ loop and can utilize any function available to the theme when it renders posts. posts_per_page By default, the type argument controls how many posts are loaded each time Infinite Scroll acts. For the scroll type, seven (7) posts are loaded each time Infinite Scroll is activated. For the click type, a site’s “Blog pages show at most” value found under Settings → Reading is used. ","length":814,"tokens":180},{"title":"Infinite Scroll","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/infinite-scroll/","content":"If, however, a theme’s layout expects a certain number of posts, the posts_per_page argument will override the defaults discussed in the preceding paragraph. This control is beneficial, for example, in a theme with a three-column layout where greater or fewer than three posts would result in an uneven layout. Examples With as wide a variety of themes and themers as exists, we aimed to provide enough control over how Infinite Scroll behaves as is necessary to support many themes. That said, our experience on WordPress. com showed that generally, each theme needs very few configuration options. To demonstrate, we’ve provided the Infinite Scroll configuration of WordPress default themes. Twenty Twelve /** * Add theme support for infinite scroll. ","length":753,"tokens":148},{"title":"Infinite Scroll","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/infinite-scroll/","content":"* * @uses add_theme_support * @return void */ function twenty_twelve_infinite_scroll_init() { add_theme_support( 'infinite-scroll', array( 'container' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 'content', ) ); } add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'twenty_twelve_infinite_scroll_init' ); For those unfamiliar with the Twenty Twelve theme, it uses content-{post format} php template parts and has no widget area below posts, so we’ve omitted the footer_widgets and render arguments. In reality, since the container value matches the default, that argument could be omitted as well; we’ve left it for clarity. Twenty Eleven /** * Add theme support for infinity scroll. ","length":643,"tokens":173},{"title":"Infinite Scroll","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/infinite-scroll/","content":"*/ function twenty_eleven_infinite_scroll_init() { add_theme_support( 'infinite-scroll', array( 'container' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 'content', 'footer_widgets' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; array( 'sidebar-3', 'sidebar-4', 'sidebar-5', ), 'footer' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 'page', ) ); } add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'twenty_eleven_infinite_scroll_init' ); Twenty Eleven comes with footer widget areas, which wouldn’t be reachable when you scroll down as new posts would be added whenever you reached the bottom. To solve this, we pass an array with the IDs of those widget areas to footer_widgets.  Now, if one of those sidebars has a widget, our Infinite Scroll plugin will detect it, and switch to the click type automatically (where you click to load more posts on demand), so your footer content is still perfectly accessible. If your theme has footer widgets, consider this approach as you greatly improve the experience of your users. ","length":932,"tokens":261},{"title":"Infinite Scroll","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/infinite-scroll/","content":"Twenty Ten /** * Add theme support for infinity scroll */ function twenty_ten_infinite_scroll_init() { add_theme_support( 'infinite-scroll', array( 'container' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 'content', 'render' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 'twenty_ten_infinite_scroll_render', 'footer' =&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 'wrapper', ) ); } add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'twenty_ten_infinite_scroll_init' ); /** * Set the code to be rendered on for calling posts, * hooked to template parts when possible. * * Note: must define a loop.

Do It With Style The last missing piece is how to make Infinite Scroll blend perfectly with your site design. Infinite Scroll relies on the theme supporting body_class, and it provides theme developers with the utmost flexibility to improve the experience by using some specific body classes: whenever Infinite Scroll is active there will be an infinite-scroll class available on body; if the Infinite Scroll type is “scroll”, there will also be a neverending class too. Once the last post in a blog has been loaded, there will be an infinity-end class added. With these, you can hide your regular footer and navigation links, and show them again when Infinite Scroll is finished. ","length":901,"tokens":188},{"title":"Infinite Scroll","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/infinite-scroll/","content":"Example: /* Hides navigation links and site footer when infinite scroll is active */  infinite-scroll #navigation,  infinite-scroll. neverending #footer { display: none; } /* Shows the footer again in case all posts have been loaded */  infinity-end. neverending #footer { display: block; } There are also two elements that you’ll want to style so that they fit in with your theme: span. infinite-loader is the loading indicator that is displayed while new posts are being retrieved. It is inserted as a child of container, and it is possible that after it is no longer needed, it will be hidden rather than removed from the DOM. Ensure that your CSS handles both cases. div#infinite-handle is the Load more posts button shown for type=click. You can ignore this if your theme will always use type=scroll and will never have any footer widgets.

If so, here are a few key steps that can help you solve the problem: Check if the error you received is listed on this page. If it is, follow the instructions there to fix the issue. Disable all of your other plugins, then try to connect or use Jetpack. If Jetpack then works properly, activate your other plugins again one by one until you see the problem again, then note the plugin that caused the issue and get in touch with us. Sometimes Jetpack and other plugins aren’t compatible. Let us know and we’ll point you in the right direction. If you have a display issue, or the plugin troubleshooting above doesn’t help, install and activate one of the default WordPress themes (such as Twenty Twenty), then try again. If Jetpack features start working normally, then it means that something in your other theme is likely broken or incompatible, and you should get in touch with that theme’s authors. Be sure to let them know the troubleshooting steps that you’ve already tried. Check your site’s health status under Tools > Site Health. This page will run a number of different checks and provide important information about your WordPress configuration and any items that could require your attention. Check your XML-RPC file. You can do this by typing out your website’s domain in your browser’s address bar and adding /xmlrpc. php to the end of the address. When it loads in your browser, you should see “XML-RPC server accepts POST requests only” on a line by itself. If you see this message, but it is not on a line by itself, a theme or plugin may be displaying extra characters when it shouldn’t. See points 2 and 3 above for troubleshooting steps. If you get a 404 error or “Not Found” message, contact your webhost. They may have security in place that is blocking the XML-RPC file, which can cause issues with Jetpack and other plugins. The XML-RPC file may not be in the root folder of your WordPress install, in which case Jetpack will not work. Reinstalling the core of WordPress should replace it, or you can ask your host to do so. Check the Known Issues list and make sure you aren’t using a plugin or theme listed there. If you were using Development Mode, check your wp-config. php file and make sure that define('JETPACK_DEV_DEBUG', true); is no longer present. To verify your Jetpack connection, visit your website, copy the URL from your browser’s address bar, and paste it in the Jetpack Debug. You will see the message “Everything looks great!” if all of the tests pass. If you get an error, try reconnecting Jetpack using these exact steps: Log into the wp-admin dashboard of your site and go to Jetpack > Dashboard > Connections > Manage Site Connection. Click the Disconnect button. Click Connect Jetpack button and continue through the process on screen. Check the Jetpack Debug for your site again. If there is still an error, contact support. If you get intermittent errors from the Jetpack Debug (it works sometimes, but not all the time), try ruling out site loading speed issues by using a tool such as WebPageTest. If the performance of your site or server dips now and then, it could cause Jetpack to not be able to connect. If you find evidence of this happening, please present that to your webhost – since they have direct access to your site and server, they are the best first step to look into improving your site’s speed.

Note: This is specifically for offline, local development sites. If you have an online, staging site, you’ll want to follow the Staging Sites guide instead. You can turn on Offline Mode by adding define( 'JETPACK_DEV_DEBUG', true ); to your wp-config. php file. Make sure you add it before the /* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */ line. Offline mode automatically gets enabled if you don’t have a period in your site’s hostname, i. e. localhost. If you use a different URL, such as mycooltestsite. local, then you will need to define the JETPACK_DEV_DEBUG constant. You can also enable Jetpack’s Offline mode through a plugin, thanks to the jetpack_development_mode filter: add_filter( 'jetpack_offline_mode', '__return_true' ); While in Offline Mode, some features will not be available at all, as they require WordPress. com for all functionality—Related Posts and Jetpack Social, for example.

Your site is responding intermittently, or extremely slowly. Your site may be loading slowly. If your site can’t be loaded in less than 20 seconds, we consider it as inaccessible. This may happen if you’re on shared hosting, where your bandwidth is shared with many other websites, or if you have a lot of resources loading on your home page; this will slow your site down. Note that in some cases your site may be slow for a few minutes only. Its loading speed then comes back to normal after your hosting provider has taken measures to isolate other sites on your server that may have used too many resources and slowed everyone else’s site down for a few minutes.

This case is one that can be confusing, since the site may actually be loading, just really slow.

Most sites that activate this see an increase in traffic. Unlike many other related post plugins, we do all the analysis, processing, and serving from our cloud, so there is no additional load on your server. That’s why Jetpack Related Posts are allowed on web hosts even when similar plugins are banned. To start using Related Posts, go to Jetpack → Settings → Traffic page and activate the “Show related content after posts” toggle. Related Posts Adding Related Posts (Classic Themes) If you are using a classic theme (as opposed to a block theme, built for the new Site Editor), Related Posts will be added automatically for you under your post content. If you want to modify how and where Related Posts are displayed on one of your posts, you can add and configure the Related Posts block. You can add this block anywhere in the post content. Your block will replace the automatically added Related Posts. To add Related Posts, add a new block either with the in-post block selector or using the block selector in the post toolbar. For more detailed information on adding Jetpack blocks, see the Jetpack Blocks page. Search for the Related Posts block in any block selector to add it to your post After adding the block, you’ll see any relevant posts showing up; otherwise, you’ll see a message saying ‘Preview: Not enough related posts found’. It is only possible to add one Related Posts block to each post. Block Toolbar Click on the block to display the block toolbar. The Related Posts block offers the following options in its toolbar: The Related Posts Block toolbar options As with the image block, the Related Posts block can be set by clicking the wide-width or full-width icons. Align options The Grid View option in the toolbar displays posts side-by-side, while the List View displays them horizontally in a list format. Block Sidebar In the Block sidebar, you can choose to Display thumbnails, Display date, and Display context. You can also use the slider to change the number of related posts to display. The maximum number that can be displayed is 6. You can customize the background color and text color for the block. The background color has two options: solid and gradient: Text color Background color Gradient background color You can configure your Typography size using a pre-selected default size or custom size. Adding Related Posts (Block Themes) If you are using a block theme (such as Twenty Twenty-Two or Twenty Twenty-Three), Related Posts are not automatically added. Block themes are designed to give you more control over how the content is displayed. It’s up to you where Related Posts should be placed. To include Related Posts while using a block theme, you will need to add the Related Posts block to your theme’s Single template (the Single template is responsible for the layout of blog posts.) You can learn more about editing theme templates here. You will need to edit the Single template in the Site Editor The Related Posts block can be placed anywhere within the Single template. You will add it either with the in-post block selector or using the block selector in the post toolbar. You can refer to the Block Sidebar section above to learn more about the block configuration. If you don’t want Related Posts displayed by default, you can instead add the Related Posts block to the post content of some specific posts of your choosing. General Information Related Posts will not appear unless we think we can show at least 3 good results (to avoid simply cross-linking posts with one another). Related Posts are automatically generated based on the content of the post and any Tags or Categories you’ve added. The maximum number of Related Posts you can display is 6. Related Posts for a given article are cached for 12 hours. This feature uses the WordPress. com infrastructure and mirrors your content there for indexing. If you see intermittent issues only affecting certain posts, you can request a reindex of your site by clicking on initiate a sync manually under Data synchronization, at the bottom of your WordPress. com Settings → General → Manage connection page. Details on Related Post Thumbnails A post’s featured image will appear as the thumbnail. If you haven’t set a featured image for the post, we will look for slideshows and galleries, and then for any images that may be attached to the post. If we don’t find any image attached to that post, we’ll look for single images you may have inserted in the post. If you’ve inserted an image that is hosted on another site, we can use it too. Thumbnails are resized and cropped automatically using the Jetpack image CDN to be 350px wide by 200px tall (1.75:1 ratio) to allow for a consistent visual display. Since this is done automatically, there’s no way to fine-tune where the image is cropped. However, you can change the size of the cropped image by using the jetpack_relatedposts_filter_thumbnail_size filter. Privacy Information This feature is deactivated by default. It can be activated at any time by toggling the Show related content after posts setting in the Related posts section from Jetpack → Settings → Traffic in your dashboard. Data Used Site Owners / Users In order to generate related posts, the following information is used: WordPress. com-connected site ID, local site ID, and the post IDs of the current post and any posts determined to be related.

This feature uses the WordPress. com infrastructure and mirrors your content there for indexing. If you see intermittent issues only affecting certain posts, you can request a reindex of your site by clicking on initiate a sync manually under Data synchronization, at the bottom of your WordPress. com Settings → General → Manage connection page. Details on Related Post Thumbnails A post’s featured image will appear as the thumbnail. ","length":985,"tokens":194},{"title":"Related Posts","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/related-posts/","content":"If you haven’t set a featured image for the post, we will look for slideshows and galleries, and then for any images that may be attached to the post. If we don’t find any image attached to that post, we’ll look for single images you may have inserted in the post. If you’ve inserted an image that is hosted on another site, we can use it too. Thumbnails are resized and cropped automatically using the Jetpack image CDN to be 350px wide by 200px tall (1.75:1 ratio) to allow for a consistent visual display. Since this is done automatically, there’s no way to fine-tune where the image is cropped. However, you can change the size of the cropped image by using the jetpack_relatedposts_filter_thumbnail_size filter. Privacy Information This feature is deactivated by default.

The code snippets below provide examples of some of the filters included with Jetpack Related Posts. You can add these code snippets to a functionality plugin, or to your child theme’s functions. php file. You can also check out Jetpack’s source code to discover more filters on top of those exampled below. Note: These snippets are provided as a courtesy and our support team is unable to offer assistance in customizing them further. Change the number of Related Posts that display By default, Jetpack’s Related Posts section will include 3 posts at most. You can change this number thanks to the jetpack_relatedposts_filter_options filter, like so: function jetpackme_more_related_posts( $options ) { $options['size'] = 6; return $options; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_options', 'jetpackme_more_related_posts' ); Show the author of the posts displayed as Related Posts If you would like to display the post authors (display) name, you can do so with the jetpack_relatedposts_filter_post_context filter, like so: /** * Display the post author after the Related Posts context. * * @param string $context Context displayed below each related post. * @param string $post_id Post ID of the post for which we are retrieving Related Posts. * * @return string $context Context, including information about the post author. */ function jetpackme_related_authors( $context, $post_id ) { // Get the author ID. $post_author = get_post_field( 'post_author', $post_id ); // Get the author's display name. $author_display_name = get_the_author_meta( 'display_name', $post_author ); // Add the author name after the existing context. if ( isset( $author_display_name ) && ! empty( $author_display_name ) ) { return sprintf( __( '%1$s<span class=\"jp-relatedposts-post-author\">By %2$s</span>', 'my-plugin-slug' ), $context, esc_html( $author_display_name ) ); } // Final fallback. return $context; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_post_context', 'jetpackme_related_authors', 10, 2 ); Insert the Related Posts within your post content via a block You can use the Related Posts Block to insert the Related Posts in a custom location within your post content. Remove the Related Posts from the bottom of your posts You can remove the Related Posts from your posts by adding the following code to your theme’s functions. php, or to a functionality plugin. function jetpackme_remove_rp() { if ( class_exists( 'Jetpack_RelatedPosts' ) ) { $jprp = Jetpack_RelatedPosts::init(); $callback = array( $jprp, 'filter_add_target_to_dom' ); remove_filter( 'the_content', $callback, 40 ); } } add_action( 'wp', 'jetpackme_remove_rp', 20 ); You could then add Related Posts back to a specific post using the [jetpack-related-posts] shortcode, or by adding this shortcode directly into your template pages, thanks to the do_shortcode() function. To do so, simply add the following to your template, inside the loop, where you want Related Posts to be displayed: if ( class_exists( 'Jetpack_RelatedPosts' ) ) { echo do_shortcode( '[[jetpack-related-posts]]' ); } Change the “Related” headline at the top of the Related Posts section In this example, we can change the default “Related” headline to “Check These Out!”: function jetpackme_related_posts_headline( $headline ) { $headline = sprintf( '<p> <h3><em>%s</em></h3> </p>', esc_html( 'Check These Out!' ) ); return $headline; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_headline', 'jetpackme_related_posts_headline' ); Replace one of the Related Posts with a custom result, for a specific post function jetpackme_append_related_post( $hits, $post_id ) { // $post_id is the post we are currently getting related posts for. if ( 2194 === $post_id ) { // Add 1036 to the front of the hits array. array_unshift( $hits, array( 'id' => 1036 ) ); // Remove the last element of the array. array_pop( $hits ); } return $hits; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_hits', 'jetpackme_append_related_post', 20, 2 ); Exclude a specific post from ever appearing among Related Posts results function jetpackme_exclude_related_post( $exclude_post_ids, $post_id ) { // $post_id is the post we are currently getting related posts for $exclude_post_ids[] = 1037; // Exclude post_id 1037. $exclude_post_ids[] = 1038;// Also exclude post_id 1038. return $exclude_post_ids; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_exclude_post_ids', 'jetpackme_exclude_related_post', 20, 2 ); Exclude sticky posts from appearing among Related Posts results If you want to exclude sticky posts on your site from showing up under other posts, you can exclude it with this snippet of code: function jetpackme_exclude_sticky( $exclude_post_ids, $post_id ) { $sticky = get_option( 'sticky_posts' ); if ( ! is_array( $exclude_post_ids ) ) { $exclude_post_ids = array(); } if ( is_array( $sticky ) ) { $exclude_post_ids = array_merge( $sticky, $exclude_post_ids ); } return $exclude_post_ids; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_exclude_post_ids', 'jetpackme_exclude_sticky', 20, 2 ); Exclude an entire category from ever appearing among Related Posts results Note: These category exclusion filters will remove the category from all related post results, regardless of other categories assigned to the post. Let’s say you have category named “Dogs” that you want to completely exclude from appearing in the Related Posts section: function jetpackme_filter_exclude_category( $filters ) { $filters[] = array( 'not' => array( 'term' => array( 'category. slug' => 'dogs', ), ), ); return $filters; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_filters', 'jetpackme_filter_exclude_category' ); If you wish to eliminate the default post category then it’s a bit more complicated as the filter must exclude both posts marked as uncategorized as well as those without a category set at all. To do that use the following: function jetpackme_filter_exclude_uncategorized( $filters ) { $filters[] = array( 'exists' => array( 'field' => 'category. slug', ), ); $filters[] = array( 'not' => array( 'term' => 'uncategorized', ), ); return $filters; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_filters', 'jetpackme_filter_exclude_uncategorized' ); Selectively disable Related Posts from appearing on specific posts If you have specific posts you would like to not have Related Posts displayed on, you can use this snippet as a starting point. function jetpackme_no_related_posts( $options ) { if ( is_single( array( 17, 19, 1, 11 ) ) ) { $options['enabled'] = false; } return $options; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_options', 'jetpackme_no_related_posts' ); You can use a wide range of Conditional Tags in place of is_single. In the above example, 17, 19, 1, and 11 are the post IDs of the specific posts we want to remove Related Posts from being displayed. Those posts are still eligible to be displayed as Related Posts on other posts. Display Related Posts on Pages as well By default, Related Posts only appear at the bottom of your Posts. To display them at the bottom of your Pages as well, you can use the following filter: function jetpackme_allow_pages_for_relatedposts( $enabled ) { if ( is_page() ) { $enabled = true; } return $enabled; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_enabled_for_request', 'jetpackme_allow_pages_for_relatedposts' ); Include pages in search results for related content Add the following snippet to include pages in the Related Posts section, which would display alongside posts. function jetpackme_add_pages_to_related( $post_type, $post_id ) { if ( is_array( $post_type ) ) { $search_types = $post_type; } else { $search_types = array( $post_type ); } // Add pages. $search_types[] = 'page'; return $search_types; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_post_type', 'jetpackme_add_pages_to_related', 10, 2 ); Selectively disable Related Posts from appearing on specific pages If you have specific pages you would like not to have Related Posts displayed on, you can use this snippet as a starting point. function jetpackme_no_related_posts_onpages( $options ) { if ( is_page( 11 ) ) { $options['enabled'] = false; } return $options; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_options', 'jetpackme_no_related_posts_onpages' ); In the above example, `11` is the page ID of the specific page we want to remove Related Posts from being displayed. Those pages are still eligible to be displayed as Related Posts on other pages. Use Related Posts with Custom Post Types Related Posts will automatically work with your site’s Posts, but you can also use it with other Custom Post Types you might have, like Events, a Portfolio, or even Products. In order to get Related Posts to index and display on your Custom Post Types, you will need to add this function and filter: function jetpackme_allow_my_post_types( $allowed_post_types ) { $allowed_post_types[] = 'your-post-type'; return $allowed_post_types; } add_filter( 'rest_api_allowed_post_types', 'jetpackme_allow_my_post_types' ); Please note that you will need to edit the code above and replace your-post-type with the slug of your custom post type. We also do advise that you Reindex your site so that Jetpack will be aware of this change. You can request a reindex of your site by clicking on the “initiate a sync manually” link at the bottom of this page. If you are not seeing Related Posts show up right away with your custom post types, try clearing your browser and site’s cache. Add a default fallback image if no image can be found in a post You can define a default image that will be used with all Related Posts that do not include an image in the post content. To do so, you can follow the instructions here. Use Jetpack_RelatedPosts_Raw to build your own list of Related Posts For those times when you’d like to build your own instance of Related Posts, you can use Jetpack_RelatedPosts::init_raw() to return a static instance of Jetpack_RelatedPosts_Raw. In the example below, we’ve created a shortcode that returns a list of Related Posts. /** * Create a [jprel] shortcode. * * @param array $atts Shortcode attributes. */ function jetpackme_custom_related( $atts ) { $posts_titles = array(); if ( class_exists( 'Jetpack_RelatedPosts' ) && method_exists( 'Jetpack_RelatedPosts', 'init_raw' ) ) { $related = Jetpack_RelatedPosts::init_raw() ->set_query_name( 'jetpackme-shortcode' ) // Optional, name can be anything. ->get_for_post_id( get_the_ID(), array( 'size' => 3 ) ); if ( $related ) { foreach ( $related as $result ) { // Get the related post IDs. $related_post = get_post( $result['id'] ); // From there you can do just about anything. Here we get the post titles. $posts_titles[] = $related_post->post_title; } } } // Return a list of post titles separated by commas. return implode( ', ', $posts_titles ); } add_shortcode( 'jprel', 'jetpackme_custom_related' ); Hide the post date on the Related Posts The appearance of Related Posts can now be changed in the customizer, by going to Appearance → Customize → Related Posts and then viewing a single post. Do not add any context below each Related Post By default, Related Posts include some context, as a quick explanation of why that post was chosen as a Related Post: it can be because it belongs to the same category, or because it shares the same tag. You can remove that context via the customizer as shown in the screenshot above. Remove Related Posts from WooCommerce Products If you’d like to prevent Jetpack Related Posts from appearing on WooCommerce products (for example, maybe because your theme already includes Related Products), you can use the following: function jetpackme_exclude_jetpack_related_from_products( $options ) { if ( is_product() ) { $options['enabled'] = false; } return $options; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_options', 'jetpackme_exclude_jetpack_related_from_products' ); Filter Related Posts by Date If you’d like to restrict related posts to a specific date range, you can use the following: function jetpackme_related_posts_past_halfyear_only( $date_range ) { $date_range = array( 'from' => strtotime( '-6 months' ), 'to' => time(), ); return $date_range; } add_filter( 'jetpack_relatedposts_filter_date_range', 'jetpackme_related_posts_past_halfyear_only' );","length":12356,"tokens":3306,"chunks":[{"title":"Customize Related Posts","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/related-posts/customize-related-posts/","content":"Customize Related Posts Like Jetpack’s other features, Related Posts includes filters that allow you to customize the look of the related posts section to fit your needs.

As a first step to troubleshooting issues with Jetpack Social, check that your Jetpack connection is working properly – Jetpack Social will not work correctly otherwise. Jetpack and Open Graph tags For auto-sharing to Facebook and Twitter, your posts must have valid Open Graph meta tags. For Facebook, you can use Facebook’s Debug tool to see if your site has valid Open Graph tags. Jetpack will normally output those tags for you in your site’s source. If you are having trouble auto-sharing your posts, you can first check that you have Jetpack’s Open Graph tags in your post’s source code. It’s important that you check the individual post’s source and not your home page.

The important thing to look for is this: <!-- Jetpack Open Graph Tags --> If you see that, then you know that Jetpack is outputting its Open Graph meta tags. If you see Jetpack’s tags, but your posts still aren’t being auto-shared, then continue reading. To find your post’s source page, add ‘view-source:’ to the beginning of your post’s URL. Here’s an example: view-source:https://jetpack. com/support/jetpack-social/troubleshooting-jetpack-social/. Jetpack’s Open Graph tags are not there If you don’t see Jetpack’s Open Graph tags in your source, then it’s possible that you have another plugin that’s conflicting. Since Facebook and Twitter will give an error if there are duplicate Open Graph tags, Jetpack automatically deactivates its Open Graph tag generation when it detects that another plugin is adding them. The most popular of these plugins include Yoast SEO, Shareaholic, and the Official Facebook plugin; you can see the full list of plugins here. If you have one of these plugins active, make sure that you have enabled their Open Graph tag generation. Some do it automatically, but some of these plugins require you to configure them for them to output the tags. You should check with the plugin author for assistance. Alternatively, if you want to continue using those plugins but not their Open Graph output, then you can use this plugin to force Jetpack to output its tags: Always Use Open Graph with Jetpack. Remember to verify that you are not outputting duplicate Open Graph tags with any other plugin, as that will cause sharing your posts to Facebook to fail. Jetpack’s Open Graph tags are there but Jetpack Social still fails to share posts If you see Jetpack’s Open Graph tags in your post’s source code, yet auto-sharing to Facebook still failed, the next step would be to use Facebook’s Debug tool to see if there are any error messages. It may be that a plugin that is not on the list mentioned above or even your theme is outputting duplicate Open Graph tags. Feel free to contact us to help you interpret the results. The same applies to posting to Twitter, Tumblr and LinkedIn – the next step here is to check to see if duplicate Open Graph tags are being added to your site. You may be able to see duplicate Open Graph tags in your post’s source code (see ‘Jetpack and Open Graph tags’ above for more on this). The exact meta tags will be different depending on the plugin or theme that may be adding these tags to your source code, but all should mention open graph tags. Are your connections global? If you have multiple users who share posts on your site, your social media connections will need to be global. If they aren’t, only the user who made the social media connection will be able to auto-share posts to social media. Posts still not sharing after that? If your posts are still not being auto-shared, you can test posting the link directly to the social media page in question. If it fails, there is a general issue not related to Jetpack Social, and the best step would be to reach out to the social media platform in question. Facebook is showing the wrong image Facebook depends on the Open Graph tags to choose which image it will display for any auto-shared post. Jetpack will give several options to Facebook, including any Featured Image or Post thumbnail your post might have, as well as any other images found in your post. It is up to Facebook, however, to decide which image they will display. Also, Facebook requires that any image be at least 200px by 200px in size, and in fact, they recommend images that are at least 1200px by 630px. For more detail about Facebook’s suggested image size, take a look at their support document. If your post’s images are too small, their Debug tool will indicate that. My site uses an Internationalized Domain Name There is a known issue with sites that have an IDN. If your site uses an IDN, using Jetpack Social to auto-share posts to Facebook will fail. Using a Post Duplicator If you use a plugin to duplicate your posts, you could run into issues, because as well as duplicating the post content, it will likely also duplicate the post meta that tells Jetpack that the post has already been auto-shared with Jetpack Social, so when you publish the new post, it will fail. There are several possible solutions to this: Don’t start from a published post. Duplicate a draft post. If the plugin includes an option like “Don’t duplicate post meta” – enable that option. If the plugin doesn’t include that option, ask the plugin author if they included a filter to prevent duplicating the post meta. If there is no filter, ask the plugin author to exclude all post meta containing the ⁠⁠⁠⁠_wpas⁠⁠⁠⁠ string from ever being duplicated. Auto-Sharing to a Facebook Profile Third-party tools can no longer share posts automatically to Facebook Profiles. This includes Jetpack Social’s auto-sharing feature. You’ll either need to share your posts manually to your Facebook Profile after publishing or convert your Facebook Profile to a Facebook Page. If you’re not sure what the difference is between a Page and a Profile, here’s Facebook’s explanation. For more information about troubleshooting your Facebook connection, take a look at the Jetpack Social: Facebook support page. Unable to make an initial connection If you are unable to make the initial social media connection, try clearing your browser cache and cookies. Failing that, try resetting the connection (disconnecting the social media connection, then reconnecting). You may also need to cycle the authorization of the WordPress app (meaning disconnecting and reconnecting any app authorizations from within the social media page itself). 500 Status code If you encounter a 500 notice when trying to connect or modify a Jetpack Social connection, then it’s likely that your site’s Jetpack connection has been interrupted. To determine if this is the case, check your site’s connection in our Jetpack connection debug tool. If you see anything other than an Everything looks great! response, then you’ll want to reinstall Jetpack by following the steps here. Please note that you will need to re-save your desired Jetpack options after reinstalling. If you still see a 500 notice when trying to connect / modify a Jetpack Social connection, you can contact your web host to have them look at your PHP error logs to deduct why the 500 errors are happening.

Jetpack allows you to generate such files thanks to the Sitemaps feature. To enable Sitemaps, go to Tools → Marketing → Traffic and click the toggle switch next to Generate XML Sitemaps. Once activated, Jetpack will generate four different sitemaps for you: A general sitemap, with your public posts and pages. A news sitemap built specifically for Google News. An image sitemap. A video sitemap. Sitemap for Search Engines Jetpack’s sitemap can be accessed at yourdomain/sitemap. xml. No need to do anything extra on your end, just make sure that the Sitemaps feature is enabled! The sitemap file generated by Jetpack is available to every search engine that supports the protocol, including Google, Yahoo!, Bing, Ask. com, and others. If you would like to learn more about the protocol, visit sitemaps. org. News Sitemap News sitemaps are very similar to standard XML sitemaps for search engines, but they are specific to Google News. Publishers must be pre-approved for Google News before Google will index a news sitemap. News sitemaps include only posts published in the last 48 hours. Once you activate the Sitemaps feature, you’ll be able to access your news sitemap at yourdomain/news-sitemap. xml — again, you don’t need to do anything extra. Approved publishers must log in to Google Search Console and add their news sitemap location as another sitemap. Don’t forget to apply to get your posts listed in Google News. Image and Video Sitemaps The image and video sitemaps help search engines index media on your site so that it can be displayed in searches for that specific type of media, e. g. images or video files. Sitemap Update Frequency The News sitemap is generated on the fly when requested. That is, new posts are added to this sitemap right away. Other sitemaps including post, image, and video sitemaps are automatically updated around every 12 hours by using WP-Cron. How to add more Post Types to the sitemap The default sitemap only includes Posts, Pages, and the Custom Post Types included in Jetpack. If you’d like to add a new Custom Post Type to the default sitemap, you can use the jetpack_sitemap_post_types filter to specify your own array of post types to include. The News sitemap, on the other hand, only lists posts by default. To add another post type to the News sitemap, use the jetpack_sitemap_news_sitemap_post_types filter. How to disable the Image sitemap The Image sitemap is enabled by default. You can disable it by adding the following code to your site: add_filter( 'jetpack_sitemap_image_skip_post', '__return_true' ); Note: The above code snippet is provided as-is for you to use as a starting point for making your own customizations. We do not provide additional support for customizing or changing how Jetpack functions on your site. Use Jetpack’s Sitemap feature alongside other Sitemap plugins There are a number of plugins in the plugin repository that allow you to create sitemaps for your WordPress site. If you already use such a plugin, you can either remove that plugin and use Jetpack’s Sitemap feature instead, or leave Jetpack’s Sitemap disabled. We won’t activate our Sitemap feature if we detect you’re already using one of the more popular sitemap plugins on your site. My Sitemaps are enabled. What’s next? While search engines can find your sitemap by visiting your site’s robots. txt, for a new site, it can be quite a while before search engines discover and start crawling your site. To help jump start this process, it’s a good idea to submit your sitemap (along with other information about your site), to the various webmaster tools programs that search engines offer, like Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. You’ll need to add and verify your site on both services before you’re able to submit the sitemap. Troubleshooting My sitemap does not update The News sitemap is generated on the fly when requested. That is, new posts are added to this sitemap right away. Other sitemaps including post, image, and video sitemaps are automatically updated around every 12 hours by using WP-Cron. If you have noticed that your sitemaps are not updated after 12 hours, please contact us via our dedicated forum or via this contact form. I want to update the Jetpack sitemap, specifically the URLs submitted to Google. This is an automated process Jetpack takes care of: Jetpack updates the sitemap file every 12 hours (or every time the content changes in the case of the News Sitemap). This happens on the server-side, not on Google. If you want to update the sitemap(s) directly in Google Search Console, you need to make sure that the sitemap(s) XML file gets updated first on the server. “Sitemap cannot be read” error in Google Search Console Crawl errors using Jetpack generated sitemap This appears in the Google Search Console or any other search engine console management (most likely it’s Google). Depending on the error detected, the solution might change – we don’t have a complete list of errors at the moment, we’re working on it. If you are using a different plugin for SEO related stuff, stick with that. Alternatively, if you still want to use the Jetpack sitemap, then you need to deactivate any other SEO or Sitemap plugins. 404 error when trying to load the sitemap The first thing to try is to head to Settings > Permalink and click saving. If that doesn’t help, there may be an issue with rewrite rules on your server, or in your . htaccess file. Check if you have any security or redirection plugins enabled. If you can’t find anything, ask your host to check for any rewrite rules that might be interfering. The sitemap doesn’t list the image URL served by Jetpack CDN (Site Accelerator) This is expected as the sitemap lists the original URLs even though the images are served by the Site Accelerator feature. The sitemaps are constantly being purged and moved to trash If Jetpack has been recently updated to a new version, it might have run into a version mismatch in the `plugin_upgrade` function. Try deactivating and deleting Jetpack entirely, and then trying to reinstall it. If you can’t remove the Jetpack plugin via the wp-admin of your site, FTP into your site and delete the folder `wp-content/plugins/jetpack`. If you’re not sure how to do this, ask your hosting company for help. After that’s done, you can reinstall Jetpack by following these instructions. Despite Jetpack is being well-connected, I can’t activate the Jetpack Sitemap Jetpack won’t activate the Sitemap feature if it detects that you’re already using another popular sitemap plugin. Deactivate any other SEO or Sitemap plugin and try again. I see a blank sitemap, displays a white page or a header with no URLs There are several reasons why the Jetpack sitemap displays a blank page. Try the following: check for conflicts: deactivate and reactivate your plugins one by one. Check for any security feature you may have enabled, and try temporarily disabling them. Search for any firewall on your server-side that might be conflicting– your host should be able to help you with that. Update Jetpack to its latest version. Toggle off/on the Sitemap feature. Check if your cache plugin is synced, or try disabling it completely Empty News sitemap If you have a blank News Sitemap, first follow the same troubleshooting steps outlined above for the main sitemap. Also, make sure that you have published something recently, and that you have submitted the site to Google News. There are no XML-Tag or Missing XML-Tag errors Try temporarily deactivating all your plugins and check if that solves the problem. If it works, then reactivate each plugin one by one to find out which one is causing problems. If the error still persists, then reach out to us directly via our dedicated forum or via this contact form. My Sitemap(s) are not showing all of my site’s URLs The general sitemap and news sitemap have limits of 2000 and 1000 URLs respectively, to keep sitemaps within the 50MB size limit. If you need to increase that limit, you can add the following constants to your site’s wp-config. php file and edit the values as required: define( 'JP_SITEMAP_MAX_ITEMS', 2000 ); define( 'JP_NEWS_SITEMAP_MAX_ITEMS', 1000 ); You will then need to deactivate and reactivate the Sitemaps module in Jetpack to trigger a new index.

Note: This is specifically for online, staging sites. If you have a local development site, you’ll want to follow the Offline Mode guide instead. The Jetpack plugin tries to automatically detect staging sites based on the default way WordPress defines environments and patterns used by some hosting providers. We’re usually able to detect staging sites and automatically enable Staging Mode on the following platforms: WP Engine Kinsta DreamHost Pantheon Flywheel Cloudways Azure WPServeur Liquidweb WP Stagecoach However, this won’t work in all cases. If needed, you can manually turn on Staging Mode by adding define( 'JETPACK_STAGING_MODE', true ); to your staging site’s wp-config. php file. Make sure you add it before the /* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */ line. Note: Your staging site’s homepage must be publicly accessible in order to use Staging Mode. Staging sites behind a login page are not compatible with Staging Mode. Using Staging Mode When your Jetpack site is accessed in staging for the first time, you will get a “Safe Mode” warning as Jetpack will notice that the staging site is a copy of your production site. Safe Mode in Jetpack Since this is a “new” site, you will want to click the button “Create a fresh connection”. Recommended Staging Workflow Manual Process In terms of a workflow between your production and staging sites, we’d advise the following: Migrate the database from your production to staging site. Make sure to flag the staging site with Jetpack staging constant. At the “Safe Mode” prompt, click “Create a fresh connection”. Make your changes on the staging site. Migrate your changes back to your production site. When you access your WP Admin on your production site, click “Create a fresh connection” when the “Safe Mode” prompt displays. Automated Process If your hosting provider includes functionality to create a staging site using an automated process, you can use that. When accessing the staging site, you will get a “Safe Mode” prompt. You will want to “Create a Fresh Connection”, make your changes, and then deploy staging to production. The flow, in this case, would be: Clone to Staging. Staging site will enter “Safe Mode”. Create a fresh connection. Make changes to the staging site. Move to production. On production, you will get the “Safe Mode” warning again. Create a fresh connection since this is now a “new” connection compared to the staging environment. How Staging Mode Works While in Staging Mode, your staging site will act like your production site in virtually all ways, except no data is passed up to WordPress. com and you cannot disconnect the staging site (to prevent an issue that would lead to problems with your production site).

XML-RPC Support: WordPress. com and Jetpack XML-RPC is used by Jetpack to connect sites to WordPress. com. Some hosts and plugin developers believe that blocking access to /xmlrpc. php will stop various hacking attempts. However, XML-RPC support has been built into WordPress core since version 3.5 and is a stable tool. Jetpack, much like other plugins, services, and apps (like our mobile apps), relies on the XML-RPC API to communicate with WordPress. com. If this is blocked, your Jetpack connection will not work correctly. To learn more about how Jetpack uses XML-RPC, see our support article about Jetpack and XML-RPC. Allowlist IPs You should be able to protect a site’s XML-RPC file without having to allowlist specific IP ranges. The most popular hosts out there use tools like fail2ban or ModSecurity, for example.

Get in touch. WooCommerce Shipping & Tax WooCommerce Shipping & Tax uses Automattic’s servers and a connection to our partners to enable useful features for your store. Some of these features (such as those relating to tax calculations and shipping) require data from your site to work. Payments If you choose to accept payments with Stripe or PayPal, we may share the email address you provide us with whichever service you’ve chosen to determine whether there’s an existing account and, if one doesn’t exist, automatically create one. Please note that if you use Stripe, they provide us with access to your payments data and account activity. We do not store this data. When processing payments, some of your — and your customer’s — data will be passed to the respective third party, including information required to process or support the payment, such as the purchase total and your customer’s billing information. Please see the respective third party’s privacy policy (Stripe’s Privacy Policy and PayPal’s Privacy Policy) for more details. Tax Calculations Tax Calculations are provided by TaxJar. If you use the tax calculations feature, TaxJar receives information related to your customer’s purchase, including the value of goods in your customer’s cart, the value of shipping, your address, and the destination address. All data that flows between your site and Automattic, and between Automattic and TaxJar, is encrypted, end to end, via HTTPS. Please see TaxJar’s Privacy Policy for details about how they handle this information. Shipping Rates and Labels To take advantage of the real-time shipping rates and shipping label features of WooCommerce Shipping & Tax, certain information about you and your customer (as it relates to shipping), shopping carts, orders, and the configuration of your site are passed to our partners, EasyPost, and the respective mailing service, such as USPS or Canada Post, via Automattic’s servers. In terms of data handling, we validate (but do not store) data you send to us and then pass that data on to our partners. Our partners process the data under the terms of their agreements with Automattic and their own privacy policies. All data that flows between your site and Automattic, and between Automattic and our partners, is encrypted, end to end, via HTTPS. To display real-time carrier shipping rates (such as for USPS and Canada Post), WooCommerce Shipping & Tax sends information related to a shipment from your site to our servers, including: Shipping zone settings for validation, when you (the merchant) make changes and when fetching the rates for the customer, including origin postcode, list of enabled delivery services, and list of custom packages you add to the packaging manager. Purchased products’ dimensions, weight, product IDs, and quantity. Package destination address (street, postcode, city, country, state). Additionally, once each day, WooCommerce Shipping & Tax asks our servers for any updates to the settings for each shipping service. This allows us to add new services and shipping options without you having to explicitly update. We store certain portions of this data (such as user ID, site ID, store location, currency, package/product dimensions, and software versions). This data is not shared with our partners. To provide shipping labels, WooCommerce Shipping & Tax sends shipping information from your site to our servers, including: Merchant and customer names, addresses, and phone numbers. Label packaging settings (dimensions and weight of the packages). Your selected WordPress. com payment method. To purchase shipping labels, you are required to have a payment method (credit card) saved on file with WordPress. com. We keep a copy of each shipping label on our servers, and our partners also keep a copy of shipping labels on their servers. This makes it easier for you to reprint labels and receive help with any support requests. Orders We sync any data related to your site’s orders, with the following exceptions: Purchaser’s billing and shipping street address. Purchasing billing and shipping company’s name. Purchaser’s email address. Purchaser’s phone number. Transaction ID. Purchaser’s IP address. Purchaser’s user agent. Usage Data Collection To help improve WooCommerce Shipping & Tax, our server automatically logs each request from your site. Each request is tagged with a unique ID that your site randomly generates when WooCommerce Shipping & Tax is activated for the first time. This unique ID is an anonymous identifier that is not mapped back to you. To protect the anonymity of you and your customers, we strip merchant and customer identifying details (the merchant name, street address, phone number, and customer name, street address, and phone number) from each request before it’s logged. Additional Data We also sync the following data with each request: Shipping zone settings, used for validation. Fetching payment methods, as configured on WordPress. com. Syncing this data enables a number of useful features, including showing appropriate shipping methods and making sure we return correctly translated text and units of measurement for your store. We also collect information about what happens when you use our services (e. g., page views, button clicks, etc.) along with information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type and operating system. We use this information to, for example, provide our services to you, as well as gain insights on how people use our services and how we can improve those services. Please refer to our public code repository for all WooCommerce-related data points synced via Jetpack.

Oftentimes, though, the system would recognize the new URL as a new site and would then assign a new blog ID, despite the fact that it’s the same site. It then appears that your historical statistics and site subscribers are “lost.” This is what we call an “Identity Crisis.” How does Safe Mode Help? Safe mode helps prevent these problems before they start. There are several cases where your Jetpack-enabled site’s URL could change: You bought a new domain name and updated your site to use that domain. You clone your site from production to staging. You allow two URLs to point to the same WordPress installation. Any other scenario where the URL of your site might change. In most cases, we can safely update the URL and not cause an Identity Crisis. But, there are a handful of cases where we’re not able to automatically determine whether we should update the URL in our data caches. In these cases, Jetpack takes some extra steps to make sure that we’re not causing an Identity Crisis: We don’t allow syncing any more information from the Jetpack-enabled site to the WordPress. com caches. We begin displaying the Jetpack Safe Mode notice. We continue showing that notice until an admin of your site resolves the potential Identity Crisis. What does the Safe Mode notice look like? When the notice is first displayed, you’ll see something like this: Safe mode activated screen Clicking the “Safe Mode” text at the bottom of the notice will hide the notice and leave your site in Safe Mode. Clicking the “Move your settings” button will show you a notice that confirms your settings have been migrated successfully. Clicking the “Create a fresh connection” button will start the Jetpack connection process. What does each button mean? Looking at the above screenshot, there are three actions you can take. Below is an explanation of why you would click each button. Stay in Safe Mode If you have cloned your site for testing purposes, then you’ll want to click the “Safe mode” text at the bottom of the notice. This will keep your site in Safe Mode and hide the notice. Many hosts will refer to this as a “staging” environment. Safe mode activated screen After clicking the “Safe Mode“ text, you will see a “Jetpack Safe Mode” button appear in the admin bar. Clicking that button will open the initial Safe Mode dialog box again in case you need to fix your connection using one of the other methods. Move your settings You would click the “Move your settings” button if the new site URL is replacing your old site’s URL. The most common case is when you are moving a site from a development environment to a production environment. For example: Going from newsite. mydevelopmentwebsites. com to newsite. com. After clicking this button, WordPress. com will migrate all of your stats and subscribers from the old site to the new site and then we will place the old site in staging mode. Note: After clicking the “Move your settings” button, the Safe Mode notice should disappear immediately on your new site but it could take a few minutes for stats and subscribers to migrate. Create fresh connection You would click the “Create a fresh connection” button when you’re creating a new and separate site. The most common instance for this would be to create a copy of site A that will be used as a starting point for site B. After clicking the “Create a fresh connection” button, you will be redirected to WordPress. com to authorize the connection. After clicking the “Approve” button there, your new Jetpack-enabled site will have its own connection and the Safe Mode notice should disappear.","length":4228,"tokens":931,"chunks":[{"title":"Safe Mode","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/safe-mode/","content":"Safe Mode Safe Mode helps to prevent an “Identity Crisis” with development and staging sites.

We rely on IP addresses stored and provided by your server for this to work properly. Unfortunately, your server may not return any IP address in some cases, thus blocking Brute Force Attack Protection from working properly. The Brute Force Attack Protection feature will be disabled when this happens, and we will let you know. If that happens, do not hesitate to send a link to this page to your hosting provider, so they can take a look and fix the issue for you. They can also contact us directly via this contact form if they need more information. Unblock yourself when your IP address was blocked by Brute Force Attack Protection feature If you tried to log in to your site multiple times but failed to log in because you had forgotten your password, you may end up being blocked by Brute Force Attack Protection feature.

No matter what size your site is, there’s always someone or something trying to “break in”. WordPress is very secure and usually the weakest point is someone’s password. Bots consequently try to guess people’s passwords to get in.

For example, if a bot tried to gain access to site A, and then went to site B, Brute Force Attack Protection would already know who this bot is and before it even tries to get into site B, it would be blocked.

WordAds requires a paid upgrade. See our information page for more details. Jetpack allows the integration of WordAds — a unique ad program from WordPress. com — as a one-click feature designed to help you generate income from your WordPress site. We provide more than just high-quality ads: we’ve also determined the best placements to guarantee the highest revenue and most reliable compatibility across most WordPress themes. Our experience is based on working with tens of thousands of users over the years. Activating WordAds WordAds is available to anyone who has purchased the Jetpack Security or Complete Plan — no approval process is required. Once you’ve purchased the plan, activate the feature in your WordPress. com dashboard under Tools → Earn → Earn Ad Revenue → Settings then click on “Join WordAds“. You can then toggle the “Enable ads and display an ad below each post” option and save the settings to start seeing ads on your site right away. You can also tweak ad placement settings and view your earnings on WordPress. com. Note: If your WordAds application was previously approved on a Jetpack free plan, you may continue using WordAds. However, new applications will require a Jetpack Security or Complete plan. Controlling Ad Placement You can control where ads are placed on your site by adjusting the settings in your site’s Dashboard, at Jetpack → Settings → Traffic. You can also use the Ads widget to place an ad unit in any widget area on your site, from Appearance → Widgets. Finally, you can use the [wordads] shortcode or the Ad Block to place an ad unit within the content of any post or page. If you are using [wordads] shortcode, make sure the Shortcode Embeds option is enabled otherwise the ads for the shortcode will not appear.

You can also find this dashboard by navigating to My Sites → Tools → Earn → View Ad Dashboard → Earnings from your WordPress. com dashboard.

You can also include custom ads. txt entries to Ads settings under Jetpack → Settings → Traffic. FAQ Is my site eligible for WordAds? A Jetpack Security or Jetpack Complete plan is required in order to use WordAds on your site. Ads are enabled. Why don’t they show up? If you have any plugins for minifying JavaScript, try deactivating those and see if it helps. Check that the area where you’re displaying ads is large enough. For example, if you have a very narrow sidebar that is smaller than the ads, no ads will be displayed there. Ads are shown on my site. Why don’t I see any earnings? Earnings are calculated daily, so if you just recently activated ads today, check tomorrow. What you see here is an estimate that will be finalized around the second week of the following month. Payments are sent on or about the last day of the following month. If you earned less than $100 in a given month, your earnings will carry over to the next month instead. Why do I only see WordPress. com ads? It’s normal to see only WordPress. com ads for the first 24 hours or so after activation. After a day or two, you should start to see ads from other advertisers. Why do I see ads from Google? We work with a wide variety of advertising partners, so it’s likely that you will see ads from various other networks. Can I customize my ad placement beyond the settings provided? You can control the placement of the header ad with do_action( 'wordads_header_ad' ); (generally added to theme files directly, or child themes if you are not using a custom theme on your site). Anywhere the wordads_header_ad action gets called in your theme is where the top/header ad will be displayed. If that code snippet gets added more than once to your theme, only one top header ad will be displayed. Note that at the top of each page additional ad placement option must be turned on. You can also add custom filters to your functions. php file to disable ads in certain locations. Disable ads from displaying at the bottom of posts using this filter. Disable ads from displaying at the top of your site using this filter. You can find even more filters in this WordAds. co post. You can then combine those with conditional tags to remove ads on specific pages. You can add the code snippets above to your theme’s functions. php file or to a functionality plugin. What format are the ads? Ads in posts/pages are Medium Rectangle size (300×250). The ad at the top of your site is Leaderboard size (728×90). The ad widget lets you select Medium Rectangle (300×250), Wide Skyscraper (160×600) or Leaderboard (728×90). If you have more questions about how ads work, you can read this document. Note: By activating ads, you agree to the Automattic Ads Terms of Service. Have questions? Feel free to contact support for more personalized assistance. WordAds and US Privacy Laws The information we share includes online identifiers; internet or other network or device activity, and geolocation data, but never a name or contact information. Some US states have laws that give consumers more transparency into, and control over, the personal information that for-profit companies doing business in those states collect about them. We have introduced a toggle in the settings page in the dashboard that allows you to enable targeted advertising in all US states. You can choose whether you want to enable this on your site. If you choose not to enable targeted advertising, then generic ads will be displayed for any of your visitors who come from IP addresses in relevant states. Enabling targeted ads for consumers in relevant states for sites on a paid plan is a two-step process: You enable the targeted advertising toggle on the WordAds settings page (via Tools → Earn → View ad dashboard → Settings). Make sure to save the settings before moving to step 2 below. You enable the Do Not Sell or Share Link widget or use the [privacy-do-not-sell-link] shortcode to add the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link to your site. If your site has a paid plan, it is mandatory to add this link if you want to show targeted ads in the relevant states. When you add the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link to a site, any visitor who clicks on the link will get a pop-up modal that allows them to opt out of ads being personalized to them based on their visits to your site. When you enable the toggle on the settings page, you have the option of providing a link to your site’s privacy policy. If you choose to do so, the link you provide will be included as part of the pop-up modal text. The “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” links only display to IP addresses in relevant states. You will also be able to see the link when you are logged in regardless of your geolocation so that you can test and preview the position of the link. Privacy Information This feature is deactivated by default, and unlocking/activating it requires an upgrade to the Security or Complete plan. It can be deactivated at any time by toggling the Enable ads and displaying an ad below each post in the Ads section from Jetpack → Settings → Traffic in your dashboard. Data UsedSite Owners / UsersTo process payments via PayPal, the following site owner-related information is utilized: site owner’s email address, physical address, site URL, and WordPress. com-connected site ID. For compliance with US tax regulations, we also collect whether the site owner is a US Resident (or based in the US), and if so, we collect tax reporting information including Social Security Number or US Tax ID, Full Name or Business Name, and physical address. Site Visitors We collect and send the following information (made available from the visitor’s browser) to our Demand Partners: IP address, geographical data (derived from the IP address), user agent, operating system, device type, unique user ID (randomly generated identifier), current URL, and IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) interest category. The advertising partners may use that information to display personalized ads to those visitors. The sharing of this information with our advertising partners may be considered a “sale” of information under US privacy laws.

Honoring DNT Do Not Track (DNT) is a feature in web browsers and websites that asks advertisers and other web software providers to not track individuals’ browsing habits. If you’ve enabled Google Analytics using Jetpack, you can force Google Analytics to honor any visitors with DNT enabled and not track their activity (i. e. post and page views) by adding the following code snippet to your site: add_filter( 'jetpack_honor_dnt_header_for_wga', '__return_true' ); More about adding code snippets to your site here. More about the add_filter() example here. Frequently Asked Questions I connected to Google Analytics, but I’m not seeing visits reported. Is it working? Most Google Analytics reports do not work in real time. Reports are normally delayed by at least a few hours. Use Real Time reports in Google Analytics to monitor activity on your site as it happens. The following Google help page will show you how to check whether your tracking code has been installed properly or not. If you are not seeing visits reported after 24 to 48 hours, and you know you have had visitors based on your your Jetpack Stats, go back to your Google Analytics dashboard and check that your domain is spelled correctly, does not contain WWW, and matches your primary domain. If it meets all of those criteria, generate a new Tracking ID. Enter the new ID after visiting Jetpack → Settings → Traffic from your WordPress dashboard and scrolling down to ‘Google Analytics’, following the steps outlined above. The data from Jetpack stats and Google Analytics doesn’t match. Is something broken? Jetpack stats and Google Analytics use different methods to identify and track activity on your site. You can expect Google Analytics and Jetpack stats to always show slightly different totals for your visits, views, etc. However, you will be able to notice the same trends and patterns in both systems. Where can I get support for using Google Analytics? Google Analytics is a very popular website analytics service, and you can find plenty of information about it in books, workshops, blog posts, online forums and more. We suggest you start with Google’s help center for Analytics, and specifically the getting started guide. You can also check out the Analytics support forum, where you can interact with other Analytics users. Privacy Information This feature is deactivated by default, and activating/unlocking it requires an upgrade to either the Security or Complete plan.

Once you’ve arrived on WordPress. com, toggle the Track your WordPress site statistics with Google Analytics setting in the Google Analytics section. Data Used Site Owners / Users This feature uses the site owner’s Google Analytics tracking ID in order to integrate with the service. Additionally, for activity tracking (detailed below): IP address, WordPress. com user ID, WordPress. com username, WordPress. com-connected site ID and URL, Jetpack version, user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. Site Visitors Please refer to the appropriate Google Analytics documentation for the specific type of data it collects. For sites running WooCommerce (also owned by Automattic) and this feature simultaneously and having all purchase tracking explicitly enabled, purchase events will send Google Analytics the following information: order number, product id and name, product category, total cost, and quantity of items purchased. Google Analytics does offer IP anonymization, which can be enabled by the site owner. Activity Tracked Site Owners / Users We track when, and by which user, the feature is activated and deactivated. We also track when, and which, configuration settings are modified. Site Visitors This feature sends page view events over to Google Analytics for consumption. For sites running WooCommerce-powered stores, some additional events are also sent to Google Analytics: shopping cart additions and removals, product listing views and clicks, product detail views, and purchases. Tracking for each specific WooCommerce event needs to be enabled by the site owner.

It allows you to use an iCalendar link to display a list of events on your site. This feature can be used for any event list, but it was created especially with musicians in mind so they can rock the web with a list of tour dates. Here is an example of an embedded events list. Note that the styling will vary depending on your theme. Getting a Calendar Link First, you will need to get an iCalendar link. Google Calendar is a free calendar application from Google you can use to create a calendar and get an iCalendar URL. Access your Google Calendar, click on the little arrow next to your calendar name, and select the settings link. Click on the calendar name you want to embed (Tasks, in this example). Click on the green ICAL button (next to Calendar Address). Copy and paste the link that displays (it will begin with “HTTP” and end with “. ics”). Make sure your calendar is public in the “Share this Calendar” section, or your site will not be able to see the calendar to embed it. Events List Shortcode You can embed a list of events into a post or page using an iCalendar URL and a shortcode. Add the following shortcode to your post:[upcomingevents url=\"ICALENDARURL\"]Replace “ICALENDARURL” with your iCalendar URL. Make sure you’ve included quotes around the link in the shortcode. To limit how many events appear, add a number parameter to the shortcode, such as number=3.

Embedding a Google Calendar Feel free to use the Google Calendar widget if you want more than just a list. Frequently Asked Questions Why aren’t my calendar changes showing up right away? Calendar . ics files aren’t updated immediately by providers such as Google Calendar, so there could be a delay. In addition, WordPress. com caches the calendar data for one hour. So if you don’t see calendar changes immediately, wait a bit to give the data enough time to get caught up. Are recurring events supported? Yes, however, some calendar programs may not save the data in a format our parser can understand. In most cases, problems happen to data imported from an outside source, so completely deleting and re-creating the recurring event using a major service such as Google Calendar or Apple Calendar on iCloud should resolve the problem. Why are the event times in the widget wrong? The Upcoming Events widget adjusts your event times to match your site’s timezone. If the times in your calendar are correct, your site may not be set to the correct timezone. You can change the Site Timezone setting in your site’s General Settings.

The European Union’s ePrivacy Directive (often referred to as the ‘cookie law’) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) place requirements on website owners and operators to provide information about, and gain consent for their use of cookies. To help WordPress users in Europe who wish to comply with the regulations, we have created a widget that can be enabled from the Dashboard. Cookie Usage WordPress and Jetpack-powered sites make use of cookies for a variety of different purposes. For more information, please refer to our dedicated cookie documentation, as well as the Automattic Cookie Policy. Full-Site Editing Themes The Cookies & Consent Banner does not presently work on Full Site Editing (FSE) themes (sometimes known as block themes) such as Twenty Twenty Two. Enabling the Widget The Extra Sidebar Widgets feature is required and is not enabled by default. If you do not see the functionality described below, please visit Control Jetpack’s Features on One Page to learn how to activate it. You can add the widget — titled Cookies & Consents Banner (Jetpack) — via Appearance — Widgets in your dashboard. It can be added to any widget position, and the banner will display at the bottom of the screen when the site is loaded. Note: The banner will only appear on posts or pages on your site that display the widget area to which you add the widget. To display the banner on the front page of your site, be sure to add the widget to a widget area that appears in that location. This will be dictated by your theme. Widget Features & Options Banner text — The banner will display a default cookie notification message, which can be customized to your needs or liking. Privacy Policy Link — The link to your site’s privacy policy. If available on your site, this will default to the URL of your Privacy Policy page. If no such page is available, it will default to https://automattic. com/cookies, the Automattic Cookie Policy, which covers Jetpack. If you wish to link to any different URL, you can select the Custom URL option and add it. Link text – The text of the link pointing to your site’s privacy policy (see Privacy Policy Link above). The default text is Cookie Policy. Button text – The text of the button that users will click to accept and dismiss the cookie notice. The default text is Close and accept. Capture consent & hide the banner — The banner’s dismissal rule can be set to one of three options: when a visitor specifically clicks on the button (this option is required for sites running WordAds), when a visitor scrolls down the page, or after a specific amount of time (as determined by you). If choosing to dismiss the banner after a specific amount of time, the minimum length is 3 seconds, and the maximum length is 1,000. Once the banner accepted/hidden, a technical cookie named eucookielaw is set, which prevents it from being displayed until the acceptance/consent expires (see Consent expires after below). If your site is using WordAds, an additional technical cookie named personalized-ads-consent will also be set, following the same expiration rule and allowing personalized ad content to be served to the accepting visitor. Consent expires after — The amount of time a visitor’s acceptance of your cookie policy will be honored. Once expired, the banner will show again to the visitor, and they will have another opportunity to accept it The default value is 180 days. Color scheme — Display the banner using a dark or light palette. The relevant CSS selector is #eu-cookie-law, if you wish to customize its appearance further. Position — Display the banner at the top part of the screen, or at the bottom (which is the default value.)

If so, here are some steps that will help you solve the problem. Before following this troubleshooting, first check that your site is publicly available, as Jetpack will not be able to connect to it otherwise! You can learn more about why it’s necessary to have your WordPress. com account connected to Jetpack here. Running the Jetpack Debug Tool The Jetpack Debug Tool can identify many different causes for connection issues. Error Messages Seeing an error message when trying to connect Jetpack or from the Jetpack Debug Tool above? Visit the Error Messages page to see the most common errors, their causes, and how to resolve them. Site Health Check your site’s health status under Tools > Site Health from the left-hand menu. This page will run a number of different checks and provide critical information about your WordPress configuration as well as any other items that may require your attention. Your xmlrpc. php File Jetpack needs this file to connect to your WordPress. com account. Start by checking example. com/xmlrpc. php (replacing “example. com” with your actual domain) in your web browser’s address bar. That page should return the following message: XML-RPC server accepts POST requests only. The message you see should look exactly the same, without any spaces or line breaks above or below it. Compare yours to this working example. If you have blank lines or extra content in your xmlrpc file, you will receive an error. Please check here for fixes before you continue, and feel free to reach out to your webhost for assistance with those instructions. Please note that your xmlrpc. php file must be in the home directory of your WordPress install. If it’s not, you can replace it by reinstalling the core files of WordPress (or asking your webhost to). Your wp-config. php and . htaccess Files If you or one of your plugins added code to either of these files, it may have caused a misconfiguration. You can check these guides for more information and typical settings to help revert the files back to their default state: wp-config / htaccess. The PHP-XML Extension The PHP on your site needs the XML extension in order to parse XML, which Jetpack needs to properly communicate with your site. Check with your webhost to make sure the PHP-XML extension is installed and active on your server. Reinstalling and Reconnecting Jetpack Sometimes you need to completely reset your connection between your site and our services. You can follow these instructions to accomplish that. Cloudflare If you are using Cloudflare on your site, check this guide to make sure Jetpack and Cloudflare are working together properly. Plugin Conflicts Sometimes other plugins can create a conflict with Jetpack that blocks it from connecting to WordPress. com. To rule out a plugin conflict, deactivate all other plugins and keep Jetpack active, then try connecting again. If Jetpack connects, you can turn your plugins back on, one by one, to make sure everything keeps working. A conflict may cause other issues in addition to not letting Jetpack connect, so check for anything else not working properly after activating each plugin. If you find that a plugin is causing a conflict with Jetpack, please reach out to that plugin’s developers to see if there is a fix to get it working with Jetpack. Theme Issues If you’re using a theme that’s not coded to modern standards or kept up-to-date with changes in WordPress development, then the theme could be creating issues with Jetpack’s connection or features. Download and temporarily switch to one of the more minimal, default WordPress themes (such as Twenty Twenty Two) and see if the connection issues are resolved. If so, then you’ll need to either replace your original theme or talk to its developers to see if they can figure out where the conflict is happening and how to solve it. Testing Your Site Speed Your site must initially respond within 5 seconds for the Jetpack connection to work correctly. You can check your site speed and overall performance with a variety of tools (like GTmetrix or WebPageTest) and follow up with your webhost by showing them the results. They may be able to help improve your site’s response and loading times from there. SSL Certificates Your SSL certificate makes sure the traffic on your site is safe and secure. Sometimes they can be misconfigured or expired, which will keep Jetpack from connecting to it. You can check for errors on your SSL certificate with this SSL Checker and test its overall health with this SSL Server Test. It should typically be graded A or A+, and you shouldn’t see any errors. The most common SSL errors that your webhost must fix are: Self-signed: The certificate was not created by using standard security practices and is considered unsafeMissing chain/intermediate certificate: Some SSL certificates are applied to your site in multiple parts. When one or more are missing in the chain, the security becomes broken and incompleteExpired: Just like a domain, an SSL certificate needs to be renewed each year, or it will expire. Certificate renewals usually happen without you having to do anything, but sometimes automatic systems at your webhost may fail to do so HTTPS Settings Check that both the SITE_URL and HOME_URL settings under Settings > General in your wp-admin dashboard are using https before your domain rather than just http. Sites that use only http are not secure and aren’t using the SSL certificate mentioned above – https loads the certificate properly and will allow Jetpack to connect to it. Also, make sure that all of your site’s traffic routes to https as well. For example, any requests to http://example. com should automatically redirect to https://example. com instead. Your webhost can help make sure that this happens as expected. For more detailed information on troubleshooting SSL issues, please refer to this guide. Server Credentials for Jetpack Backup If you have issues adding your credentials to Jetpack Backup, we recommend contacting your webhost and asking them to provide you with this information so you can then enter it successfully into your Jetpack settings: Credential type (FTP, SFTP, SSH)Server addressPort numberServer usernameServer passwordWordPress full installation path When You Should Contact Your Webhost for Support This list of issues that must be addressed by your webhost rather than Jetpack support because they are server-related: SSL certificatesChanges in IP addresses or domains/URLsMigration from one server to anotherSite is down or not responding Errors (500 / 502 / 504 / 403)Server resource or memory usageDNS problemsOutdated server software (PHP, MySQL, etc.)File and folder permissionsProblems that are still occurring even after Jetpack is uninstalled","length":6848,"tokens":1429,"chunks":[{"title":"Fixing Jetpack Connection Issues","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/getting-started-with-jetpack/fixing-jetpack-connection-issues/","content":"Fixing Jetpack Connection Issues Have trouble connecting Jetpack to WordPress. com?

You can use this feature out of the box without worrying about configuration options, or you have the option to fine-tune the sorting and filtering settings for your site search. Inline Search Features There are a lot of features in Jetpack Inline Search that make a great search experience: Supports millions of queries across millions of documents. Real-time indexing of changes to your content. Filter searches by tags, categories, custom taxonomies, authors(WordPress. com connected users only), dates, and post types. Supports all languages with custom language analysis for 29 languages. Sort by relevance or date. Boosts recent content by default. Phrase search. Customizable search algorithm and an Elasticsearch Query API. Transparently intercepts searches via WP_Query, for “search” style queries that are also the “main” query. An example sidebar showing filtering on a test site. Enabling Inline Search Once you’ve connected your site, go to Settings → Performance in your WordPress dashboard, and enable Search. This allows Jetpack to override your site’s default WordPress search system with additional customizations and filtering while still using your chosen theme’s design template and colors. If your Jetpack plan supports it, enabling instant search will introduce the new overlay experience. You can also enable Inline Search from the Jetpack Search plugin: Adding the Search Box and Editing Controls After you have enabled Search, you can click Add Jetpack Search Widget to add Inline Search to your site using your theme’s customizer. Inline Search works with WordPress’ own search widget, the search box in your theme (if there is one), and the Search (Jetpack) widget on older themes that don’t support full site editing. Full site editing (or “FSE”) is a collection of interrelated features that unlocks the ability to edit your entire site with blocks. Examples of themes that rely on the Customizer rather than the Full Site Editor include but are not limited to StoreFront and Twenty Twenty-Sixteen to Twenty Twenty-One. On the Customizer > Widgets > Widget Area, you can click the theme Search widget (if one exists) or the Search (Jetpack) widget (if you have added it) to edit the title of the widget as it shows up on your site in any of the widget areas like the sidebar. From there, you can also choose whether to display the search box or not, and whether to show the sorting selection dropdown. You can customize what post types to search and the default sort order. Finally, you can add custom filters that let your site visitors select category, tag, post format, date, post type, and so on. For advanced customizations with relevant code snippets, see how to customize Inline Search. FAQ What is Elasticsearch? Elasticsearch is an open-source project for building distributed, scalable search engines. We power many of our features using Elasticsearch instead of the MySQL database used for most of WordPress. Elasticsearch is a trademark of Elasticsearch BV, registered in the U. S. and other countries. When was instant search and filtering added to Jetpack? The ability to handle instant sorting and filtering was added in Jetpack 7.9. Be sure to give that a try too! How long will it take to index my content? New and updated content is usually indexed within seconds. When you first install Jetpack, it may take a few minutes or hours before your content is fully indexed, but after that, the index is always up-to-date. If you are an existing Jetpack user, your content will be searchable as soon as you enable the feature. What content is indexed? We index all WordPress posts, pages, and custom post types as long as the post status is one of ‘publish’, ‘trash’, ‘pending’, ‘draft’, ‘future’, or ‘private’. Does Inline Search have content limits or tiers? No limits, no tiers, no hidden costs. All your content in real-time. For the new instant search experience, note that this is no longer the case. You can check out the current billing structure for Instant Search if you are interested. How do I enable this in my theme? See how to enable Inline Search above. As mentioned above, Inline Search works with WordPress’ own search widget, the search box in your theme (if there is one), or with the Jetpack Search widget, which can display a search box, sorting controls, and custom filters that let your site visitors select category, date, post type, and more. You need to install a theme that uses the customizer and not a full site editor. You can use the customizer to add search features to your theme, including powerful filtering. Does Inline Search have any filter or action hooks? Of course! You can find those on our developer page. Can I use this for custom Elasticsearch queries? Yes! You can send any valid Elasticsearch query (ES 2.4+) to Jetpack_Search::instance()->search( $query ). Security restrictions apply. See the API developer docs for more information. Can I search post meta and custom taxonomies? Post meta is not included in the index. Custom taxonomies are currently in the index, but the indexing structure has changed, so we do not recommend them for custom queries. For better post meta and custom taxonomy support, consider using the new Instant Search on your site. I added extra filters to the search widget, but they’re not showing on the page; how do I get them to appear? Firstly, filters will only display in the widget on the search results page, after you perform a search. Secondly, when you add an extra filter to the widget – for example, to refine a search by taxonomy – the links for taxonomy terms will only appear in the search widget if there is at least one taxonomy term for the given results. Results with zero matching taxonomy terms will not show the filter controls. This is to prevent user confusion by having redundant controls taking up space on the screen. The search widget shown below is configured with Date, Post Type, and Tag fields, but only the Dates and Post types are showing because no tags matched the results.

The code snippets below provide examples of some of the filters included in the feature. You can add these code snippets to a functionality plugin, or to your theme’s functions. php file. You can also check Jetpack’s source code to discover more filters. Please note that these snippets are provided as a convenience and our support team does not offer assistance on customizing them further. Sidebar Filters: add using the customizer Sidebar Filters: add using code WooCommerce Filters: add product filters to the sidebar Adding filters to a template without using the sidebar widget Customizing the WordPress Search Query Debug Search Query Search Algorithm Filter: exclude posts Search Algorithm Filter: only search within a subset of posts Search Algorithm: search custom taxonomy Search Algorithm: adjust boosting recent content Search Algorithm: boost popular content Search Algorithm: boost posts with images Search Algorithm: boost pages over posts In order for these filters to appear, you must add the Search (Jetpack) widget to your sidebar or other widget area. Sidebar Filters: Add using the customizer Search filters can be enabled through the widget’s settings or in the customizer. First, add the Search (Jetpack) widget to your sidebar, then run a search so that you will be able to customize the results. The filters are only displayed when on a search results page, but the search box (if enabled) in the widget will get displayed on all pages. Also, the filters are only displayed if the current search results would have more than one filter. Below is an example configuration where we have three types of filters: categories, the month the post was published, and what type of post (eg page/post/product). Search Widget Settings Searching for “post” on a test site. Sidebar Filters: Add using code You can also enable sidebar filters on your search results page by adding the Search widget and then customizing them with code. Here is a simple example: function jp_search_setup_filters() { if ( class_exists( 'Jetpack_Search' ) ) { Jetpack_Search::instance()->set_filters( array( 'Categories' => array( 'type' => 'taxonomy', 'taxonomy' => 'category', 'count' => 10, ), 'Tags' => array( 'type' => 'taxonomy', 'taxonomy' => 'post_tag', 'count' => 10, ), 'Month' => array( 'type' => 'date_histogram', 'field' => 'post_date', 'interval' => 'month', 'count' => 10, ), ) ); } else { error_log( \"Jetpack search does not exist\" ); } } add_action( 'init', 'jp_search_setup_filters' ); WooCommerce Filters: add product filters to the sidebar For the filtered search of WooCommerce products we can do something similar to the other coding example: function woo_search_setup_filters() { if ( class_exists( 'Jetpack_Search' ) ) { Jetpack_Search::instance()->set_filters( array( 'Categories' => array( 'type' => 'taxonomy', 'taxonomy' => 'product_cat', 'count' => 10, ), ) ); } else { error_log( \"Jetpack search does not exist\" ); } } add_action( 'init', 'woo_search_setup_filters' ); Search Filters in action on a WooCommerce site. Adding filters to the page without using a widget If you want to add a Filters section to your theme, you can use the Jetpack_Search_Template_Tags::render_available_filters() template tag in the search. php theme template like this: <?php if ( class_exists('Jetpack_Search_Template_Tags' ) ): ?> <h2>Filter posts</h2> <?php Jetpack_Search_Template_Tags::render_available_filters(); ?> <?php endif; ?> Note that for any filters to appear, you need to have programmatically defined custom filters as per the examples above. Customizing the WordPress Search Query Jetpack Search will only work with the main search WP_Query. If you want to modify the default WordPress search page, for example, including additional post types in search results, we don’t recommend creating a custom WP_Query as this will not work with Jetpack Search. Instead, we recommend using the pre_get_posts filter. Debug Search Query Jetpack Search has built-in support for two plugins for examining the search query and search query results: Query Monitor and Debug Bar. Once the plugin is enabled, on any search page you can open the tool and go to the Jetpack Search tab to see the queries that were run and their results. Search Algorithm Filter: exclude posts by tags/post_id/etc The posts that are returned as a part of the search can be easily filtered by wrapping the main search query in a bool query that adds some filters. Here is a simple case that excludes any post with the tag slug exclude_me: function filter_jetpack_search_query( $es_query_args, $query ) { $es_query_args['query'] = array( 'bool' => array( 'must' => array( $es_query_args['query'] ), 'must_not' => array( array( 'term' => array( 'tag. slug' => 'exclude_me' ) ) ), ) ); return $es_query_args; } add_filter( 'jetpack_search_es_query_args', 'filter_jetpack_search_query', 10, 2 ); Filtering can be made significantly more complex. Here we exclude: post_ids 3, 4, and 5; the category exclude_me; and the tag exclude_me function filter_jetpack_search_query( $es_query_args, $query ) { $es_query_args['query'] = array( 'bool' => array( 'must' => array( $es_query_args['query'] ), 'must_not' => array( array( 'terms' => array( 'post_id' => array( 3, 4, 5 ) ) ), array( 'term' => array( 'category. slug' => 'exclude_me' ) ), array( 'term' => array( 'tag. slug' => 'exclude_me' ) ), ), ) ); return $es_query_args; } add_filter( 'jetpack_search_es_query_args', 'filter_jetpack_search_query', 10, 2 ); Search Algorithm Filter: only search within a category Sometimes you may only want your search results to be within a single category. Similar to excluding posts, we wrap the main query in a bool query. In this case, we will only search for posts that have the category include_me1 or include_me2. function filter_jetpack_search_query( $es_query_args, $query ) { $es_query_args['query'] = array( 'bool' => array( 'must' => array( $es_query_args['query'] ), 'filter' => array( array( 'terms' => array( 'category. slug' => array( 'include_me1', 'include_me2' ) ) ) ), ) ); return $es_query_args; } add_filter( 'jetpack_search_es_query_args', 'filter_jetpack_search_query', 10, 2 ); Search Algorithm: search custom taxonomy The search algorithm will not search against custom taxonomies by default. But you can add them to the list of fields searched against. The example below adds searching the custom taxonomy product_tag: function set_jetpack_search_fields( $query_args ) { $query_args['query_fields'] = array( 'title. en^2', 'content. en', 'excerpt. en', 'tag. name', 'category. name', 'taxonomy. product_tag. name', ); return $query_args; } add_filter( 'jetpack_search_es_wp_query_args', 'set_jetpack_search_fields', 10, 1 ); Note that this is boosting the title to have twice the weight of the other fields. This method can also be used to adjust your boosting. Search Algorithm: adjust boosting of recent content (DEPRECATED) By default, the search algorithm slightly boosts recent content over older content. Sometimes this boosting will be too much and you’ll want to completely remove it: function exclude_jetpack_search_recency( $params ) { return false; } add_filter( 'jetpack_search_recency_score_decay', 'exclude_jetpack_search_recency' ); Or you may want to make the recency boosting more aggressive for all content that is older than 30 days: function adjust_jetpack_search_recency( $params ) { return array( 'origin' => gmdate( 'Y-m-d' ), 'offset' => '30d', // all posts from the past month treated equally.

This feature can improve site performance, and is especially great for users in low-bandwidth or expensive-bandwidth environments, such as users on mobile devices. This feature is compatible with WordPress core’s lazy-loading images feature. Activating Lazy Loading Images Navigate to Jetpack → Settings → Performance. Scroll to the Performance and Speed section. Click the toggle to activate Lazy loading for images. How does the Lazy Loading Images feature work? The Lazy Loading images feature filters the post content and modifies image tags so that the src attribute loads a transparent placeholder image. For example, <img src=\"https://jetpack. com/image. jpg\" /> would become <img src=\"https://jetpack. com/placeholder. jpg\" data-lazy-src=\"https://jetpack. com/image. jpg\" /> . When JavaScript then loads, it will look for all images in the current view and replace the src attribute with what is in data-lazy-src. This also occurs as the user scrolls down the page and images come into view. How does the Lazy Loading Image feature improve site performance? By default, when a web page loads, it attempts to also load all the images that it sees in the source. For a visitor using a desktop browser, the time and bandwidth necessary to load that page may not be an issue. With mobile usage of the Internet now surpassing that of the desktop, the majority of our users are likely accessing our content with mobile devices. For mobile visitors, where the view is much narrower and bandwidth is a more significant concern, this full loading can be problematic. That’s using bandwidth to load images that they may not even want to see. By lazy loading images, those images will only load when they actually appear on-screen, reducing bandwidth usage by as much as half of what is used without lazy loading images enabled. Customizing Lazy Loading Images These filters allow you to tweak the lazy image functionality. The code snippets below provide examples of some of the filters included in the lazy images feature. You can add these code snippets to a functionality plugin or to your theme’s functions. php file. Disabling Lazy Loading Images Lazy loading images are set to be enabled for your entire site by default. You can use the filter lazyload_is_enabled to customize when lazy loading should be enabled. For example, if you don’t want lazy loading images on a certain page, you could hook in and disable lazy loading images for that page. Use a Different Placeholder Image By default, Jetpack will load a 1×1 transparent GIF, but certain implementations may call for something else. The filter lazyload_images_placeholder_image will allow you to specify your own placeholder image. Modify the Attributes of a Lazy-Loaded Image The jetpack_lazy_images_new_attributes filter will allow you to modify the attributes for a lazy-loaded image as the content is filtered. This is to allow for changes based on more customized and specific implementations. Exclude Specific Images You can instruct Lazy Loading Images to skip any image by adding the skip-lazy CSS class to an image. You can also use jetpack_lazy_images_blocked_classes filter to set additional CSS class names that shouldn’t be lazy-loaded. For example: function mysite_customize_lazy_images( $blocked_classes ) { $blocked_classes[] = 'my-header-image-classname'; return $blocked_classes; } add_filter( 'jetpack_lazy_images_blocked_classes', 'mysite_customize_lazy_images' ); Lazy Loading Images and Jetpack Boost If you use the Jetpack Boost plugin’s Lazy Loading Image feature, turning on and off the Lazy Loading Images feature will also turn on and off the Lazy Loading Image feature in Jetpack Boost.

They can also be used to connect backups when the initial connection doesn’t work. These credentials also allow Jetpack users with a Jetpack Scan plan to fix threats found in security scans. Jetpack VaultPress Backup is the backup solution provisioned for all new Jetpack plans that include backups. What are SSH, SFTP, FTPS, and FTP credentials? Every site is hosted on a server – this is where the files, directories, programs, and services that make up your site are located. SSH (Secure Shell), SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), FTPS (a. k. a FTP-SSL, and FTP Secure), and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) are different types of server credentials. These credentials allow you, or a service like Jetpack VaultPress Backup, to directly access the server that’s powering your website. SSH, SFTP, and FTPS establish secure server connections, whereas FTP does not, and for that reason, it is not recommended if SSH or SFTP is available. Server credentials are unique and different from: Your WordPress. org login Your WP Admin login Your WordPress. com login Your host’s control panel or dashboard login SSH, SFTP, FTPS, and FTP credentials provide a way to transfer files from one host to another. The manner in which this happens is different for each method: SSH (Secure Shell) SFTP – SSH File Transfer Protocol FTPS (FTP-SSL – FTP Secure) FTP – File Transfer Protocol File Access Permission Note that when creating new SFTP/SSH credentials to use with Jetpack VaultPress Backup, you need to set the correct access permissions (full read and write access) to the WordPress directory. File access permissions are a set of instructions that dictate who can access and modify WordPress files and folders. It is important to set the correct permissions to your WordPress install to allow Jetpack VaultPress Backup to back up your files (read access) and restore the files (write access). The required settings could vary depending on your host, so we can’t provide the exact permissions you’ll need. Your hosting provider can help with this, and they may even provide instructions in their support documentation. Why does Jetpack need them? We need credentials in order to restore your files and data. We can also use these to connect for backups if the Jetpack connection isn’t working. It is by far the most efficient and reliable way to back up the potentially large amounts of data involved with running a site. Note: We will never use these credentials for anything other than backups and restores without asking your permission first. Which credential type do you recommend? We recommend SSH, as it’s the most robust, secure, and efficient. Please note that currently, only unencrypted private keys are supported, which means keys without a password or passphrase. If your host doesn’t allow SSH access, we recommend SFTP as the next best option as it provides some security beyond what FTP offers. If you can’t get either, FTP will also work. Note: We do support FTPS protocol, but we do not recommend it since it is a deprecated protocol. Where do I find these credentials? Your host provides these credentials for you. You will often receive these details via email when you first create a hosting account. You can often find these credentials by referring to your host’s documentation. You can also contact them directly and they’ll point you in the right direction. How do I add server credentials?

Jetpack VaultPress Backup will start to back up your site as soon as you purchase the product, provided Jetpack’s connection is working normally. If your backups don’t start right away, you can add SSH, SFTP, or FTP credentials to bypass other issues and create a backup immediately. Credentials are also needed to restore your site from a previous backup. File Access Permissions File access permissions are a set of instructions that dictate who can access and modify WordPress files and folders.

When you reach out to your hosting provider, you can share the following with them: I’m in the process of setting up my site on VaultPress Backup, and I need server credentials to enter into the plugin so that it can perform backups and restores on my website. Could you help me determine the correct information for the following items: Protocol: FTP is fine, but SSH or SFTP would be ideal. User: The user needs to have read and write permissions for my site’s files on the server. More on why VaultPress Backup needs read and write permissions can be found here. Password: If using SSH credentials, this password is optional. Host/IP Address: If my site uses Cloudflare, I require the IP address for the server my site is located on, otherwise the URL that points to my site on the server is fine. Port: Should the port be 21, 22 or something else? SSH Private Key: If using SSH, the SSH private key cannot be password protected and must use OpenSSH format. Password protected private keys and/or keys in PuTTY format are not supported. WordPress Path: The WordPress path should point to the folder on the server where my WordPress instance lives.

General Analytics Tracking In order to better understand how our customers use Jetpack — and so that we can efficiently and effectively improve the product — we actively track activities around the product, including page views (WordPress. com and within the dashboard of your own WordPress site on which Jetpack is installed) and clicks (on any links or banners used when managing your site via WordPress. com or within the Jetpack dashboard of your own WordPress site on which Jetpack is installed, or when using the dashboard quick switcher to move between your WordPress site dashboard and WordPress. com dashboard), as well as when the Jetpack plugin is deactivated or Jetpack disconnected (tracking events related to the disconnection dialog box). We also track product suggestions activities depending on which selections or user flows are taken when using the Jetpack Assistant, and partner coupon code usage. Emails sent to you by Jetpack and WordPress. com will also include standard tracking, including open and click activities. Learn how to unsubscribe from these emails. These kinds of analytics events will be attached directly to your WordPress. com account and are handled via a first-party system that Automattic owns and maintains. In general, the following data will be sent with each such usage event: IP address, WordPress. com user ID and username, WordPress. com-connected site ID, user agent, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, and country code. This data collection is done in various ways, including embedding an invisible g. gif or v. gif image in a page. We also add a from parameter to pre-connection button links for source tracking. For users of both WooCommerce and Jetpack, additional usage tracking is in place by default. Specifically, this includes activity on site product pages, as well as cart and checkout.

By default, modules are controlled by the Jetpack user interface (UI). When a module is forced on or off, the toggle in the Jetpack user interface for that module becomes disabled. When a module is completely removed, no UI will show for that module. How are modules disabled? In cases where Jetpack has a feature that is incompatible on a hosting platform, plugin, or theme, it may be preferable to disable the module in Jetpack. This is easily done via a filter in Jetpack, however, we would caution developers to consider the user experience (UX) when disabling functionality. For example, if a user expects a commonly used module to be available, and it’s not, that could cause confusion for the user. Now that we’ve covered that, let’s look at how we can disable Jetpack modules. Disable module with popover explanation To disable a module but not remove the UI, we’ll use the option_jetpack_active_modules filter. Here’s an example: add_filter( 'option_jetpack_active_modules', 'jetpack_test_module_override' ); function jetpack_test_module_override( $modules ) { $disabled_modules = array( 'sitemaps', 'sso', ); foreach ( $disabled_modules as $module_slug ) { $found = array_search( $module_slug, $modules ); if ( false !== $found ) { unset( $modules[ $found ] ); } } return $modules; } Completely removing the module and its UI The filter that we’ll use to disable a module and remove its UI is jetpack_get_available_modules. Here’s an example: add_filter( 'jetpack_get_available_modules', 'jetpack_docs_filter_module_example' ); function jetpack_docs_filter_module_example( $modules ) { unset( $modules['photon'] ); return $modules; } Forcing modules to be active In some cases, forcing a module to be active may be preferable. For example, to minimize bandwidth, a developer could force the Photon module to be active. In these cases, it is possible to force a module on with the jetpack_active_modules filter. Here’s an example: add_filter( 'option_jetpack_active_modules', 'jetpack_docs_filter_active_modules' ); function jetpack_docs_filter_active_modules( $modules ) { return array_values( array_merge( $modules, array( 'photon' ) ) ); } Who is overriding my modules? Because of how WordPress filters work, any plugin or theme could be modifying the modules that are available and/or active. A few methods for finding where the modules are being overridden are: Change your theme then refresh the Jetpack UIDisable plugins one-by-one, refreshing the Jetpack UI each timeDownload the wp-content directory of your site via FTP or SFTP and then search for jetpack_active_modules or jetpack_get_available_modules in the directory","length":2722,"tokens":682,"chunks":[{"title":"Module Overrides","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/module-overrides/","content":"Module Overrides Jetpack has A LOT of functionality which is divided into modules.

This email will include the submitter’s IP address, timestamp, name, email address, website, and message. Data Synced (?): Post and post meta data associated with a user’s contact form submission. If Akismet is enabled on the site, the IP address and user agent originally submitted with the comment are synced, as well, as they are stored in post meta.

This guide is here to help you get to know our new system that we’re excited to share with you What are the similarities between VaultPress and Jetpack VaultPress Backup? We’ve worked hard to have the features folks love about VaultPress available within Jetpack VaultPress Backup. At a high level, the products both offer the same backup, restore, and security functionality. For example, both options can backup a site without needing FTP/SFTP/SSH credentials but need them if you want to restore a site. As a result, the core of what you know and love with VaultPress you will still find within Jetpack VaultPress Backup. What are the differences between VaultPress and Jetpack VaultPress Backup? The main differences now exist at both a code level and in the visual experience. To explain, Jetpack VaultPress Backup was built to be far more efficient than VaultPress, resulting in backup/restore speeds being far faster than what they were with VaultPress. Unlike VaultPress, Jetpack VaultPress Backup requires a working Jetpack connection to complete backups properly. Whereas VaultPress displayed backups on a single page in a separate dashboard, Jetpack VaultPress Backup shows your backups listed within your overall site’s Activity on WordPress. com. This means your restore events are now logged in your site’s Activity, an addition previously not available on VaultPress. We made this change to help unite our different interfaces from VaultPress and to help give better context for when backups occur, allowing folks to make better decisions about when to restore their site. For example, previously, you might restore your site using VaultPress without knowing when a security threat first appeared on your site. With Jetpack VaultPress Backup, you’ll be able to see inline where the threat first appeared, and work back from there to determine the best time to restore! Where are my backups? VaultPress displayed your backups on their own Backups page, listed by day (and by an hour if you had a Jetpack VaultPress Backup or Security plan). Instead of listing a page of backups labeled only with a date/time, Jetpack lists events that occur on your site. You can see these events in your site’s Activity, and restore your site to a specific event (rather than a specific date/time). This helps, for example, if you know that everything was working fine before you updated a certain plugin. Instead of searching through backups to find the one before you updated the plugin, you can just find the ‘plugin updated’ event for that plugin, and restore your site to that point. What if I want to restore? To restore your site to an earlier date, go through your site’s Activity until you see the date you want, then select an event that corresponds to the time period you want to restore to. More information about Restoring your site: Restoring using Jetpack plugin; Restoring using Jetpack VaultPress Backup standalone plugin. Where do I see security alerts?

If Jetpack does notice a problem, you’ll receive an instant email alert. You can repair the majority of security threats with just one click and get back to running your business. Take a look at all the security features Jetpack offers. Important: Jetpack Scan is not intended to be a service to clean up already hacked or malware-infected sites. While we can fix some hacked files after purchase, we do rely on the site not being infected at the time of purchase and having a clean version to compare any changed files to. In that case, we suggest following this guide to cleaning a hacked site. How do I get Jetpack Scan? Jetpack Scan is available to users who have purchased the Jetpack Scan, Jetpack Security, or Jetpack Complete plans. It is also the scan solution for any new Jetpack Security or Jetpack Complete purchase. Note: Once the site is connected to Jetpack Scan, your site will remain on the Jetpack Scan solution, even if you change or add a Jetpack plan or move your site to a new host. Getting Started Jetpack Scan is activated as soon as your purchase is complete, and your first scan is kicked off immediately. Adding Server Credentials Jetpack can scan your site without any server credentials, but server credentials are required to use one-click fixes. The server credentials can also help make the scans faster and more reliable. Read more on how to add remote access/server credentials. Navigating the dashboard Clicking on Scan under the Jetpack options in WP Admin will take you to the Jetpack. com dashboard. Make sure to authorize your WordPress. com account if you see an authorization prompt. After opening the Scan page, you will see two interfaces: Scanner and History. The scanner page provides an at-a-glance reference of the site’s current state. It will either show that the site is looking great or list the currently active threats. Clicking the Scan now button will start a new scan. On the history page, you’ll see a list of all threats the site suffered from in the past. They can be filtered by their fix/ignore status, and ignored threats can be fixed. Peace of Mind Once a scan completes, you will receive a notification if any threats are found. These notifications will be in WP Admin, via email, and on your WordPress. com dashboard. What data is scanned? All files in the plugins, mu-plugins, themes, and uploads directories. Select files from your WordPress root directory, like wp-config. php. Other select files inside the wp-content directory. How often do scans occur? Scans occur daily or when manually triggered. How do I fix threats? When a threat is detected, and you’re notified, we offer a one-click fix for most problems. You’ll see the same icon whether a threat is fixable or not. Clicking on the threat will provide more information about the problem and what can be fixed. You will also see an option to ignore the threat. Ignoring or fixing the threat will create a history of scan threats you can view. However, sometimes a website can get hacked more severely, meaning a one-click fix is impossible. In that case, we suggest following this guide to cleaning a hacked site. It will help guide you through identifying and cleaning up a hacked site and strengthening the site’s security to help prevent future hacks. Examples of threats Changes to Core WordPress Files We check your WordPress installation to see if any core files have been changed or deleted. Generally, these files should never be changed, so please remember when working on your site. WordPress functionality can and should be altered by using plugins and themes instead. If you didn’t make the changes to your core files, you should consider the files suspicious and consider replacing them. You can always contact us if you’re unsure of the changes you see. Other Vulnerabilities Web-based shells give an attacker full access to your server — allowing them to execute malicious code, delete files, make changes to your database, and many more dangerous things. Shells are usually found in files, and they can be removed by deleting any infected files from your server and replacing them with a clean version from your backup. Outdated or insecure plugins Plugins that have known security vulnerabilities will be detected by Jetpack Scan. If a newer version has patched the threat, you can update the plugin with one click. We allow you to delete the plugin from your site if there is no newer version with a fix. You’re always welcome to contact us if you have any questions about security threats or suspicious codes.

You can do this by using the filters at the top of the Activity Log. Download the backup. For users with the full-featured Jetpack plugin, you’ll click Download. For users with the Jetpack VaultPress Backup plugin, you’ll click Actions and then Download backup. The backup that will download will be a compressed file with a . tar. gz file extension. To open this file you will need to unzip it. On Mac OS you can simply double-click the file. In Windows, you can use an archiving tool such as 7-Zip.

Your plugins, themes, and uploads folders can be transferred via FTP or a File Manager tool to the wp-content folders on your WordPress site. The SQL folder contains several . sql files, each representing a database table. For example, the wp_posts table will be represented by the wp_posts. sql file. You can import your . sql files into your MySQL database in a few different ways. It’s easiest to use something like phpMyAdmin or a desktop tool like Sequel Pro.

Jetpack CDN) helps your pages load faster by allowing Jetpack to optimize your images and serve them alongside static files (like CSS and JavaScript) from our global network of servers. Note: “Photon” is now part of Site Accelerator. For general features and FAQs, please see our CDN features here. How to Activate the Site Accelerator In your site’s dashboard, go to Jetpack → Settings → Performance. In the Performance & speed section, toggle on “Enable site accelerator.” How Site Acceleration Works Image load times Our Image CDN (formerly Photon) is an image acceleration and editing service. That means that we host your images from our servers, alleviating the load on your server and providing faster image loading for your readers. It filters content but doesn’t change your database. It only acts on images in posts and pages, as well as featured images/post thumbnails via the image_downsize filter. Examples of WordPress functions using the image_downsize filter: the_post_thumbnail_url, get_the_post_thumbnail, get_the_post_thumbnail_url, wp_get_attachment_image, wp_get_attachment_image_src It will apply to old and new posts alike and can be turned on or off easily, applying the changes in just a few minutes total. Browsers that support the WebP image format will be served WebP image data (note that the file extension won’t change). Static file load times We host static assets like JavaScript and CSS shipped with the WordPress core, Jetpack, and WooCommerce from our servers as a content delivery network (CDN), alleviating the load on your server. It filters the URLs of assets that are loaded with every WordPress page. It only acts on assets shipped with WordPress core, Jetpack, and WooCommerce. Theme and plugin assets are not supported at this time. Limitations No cache invalidations. Currently, static assets are tied to the public version of WordPress, Jetpack, or WooCommerce that you’re using. For images, if you want to “refresh” an image, you will need to change its file name. Adding random query arguments, commonly known as “cache busters,” will not work. It is not possible to automatically purge all images from a site. If there is an image no longer on your server that you’d like us to purge, please contact us with a direct link to the file as it appears on your site. These will begin with i0. wp. com, i1. wp. com, i2. wp. com or i3. wp. com. Since images can only be purged manually by individual URL, there is a limit to the number we can purge. We only fetch, resize, and serve GIF, PNG, JPG, and WebP images from servers that listen on port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS. This applies to about 99.99% of the web servers in the world. If you are having issues, please try using the jetpack_photon_reject_https filter. We will not “upscale” an image in most circumstances. If your original image is 1,000px wide and you ask for Jetpack to make it 5,000px, we will serve the original 1,000px image. Upscaled images are usually of poor quality, and we want to avoid that. If your server takes longer than 10 seconds when an image is being retrieved for our CDN, the process will time out and your image will appear to be broken. Try to upload a differently-named image with a smaller dimension or file size if this happens. It’s not possible to choose or limit where in the world your images will be served from. We have servers placed all over the world, and which server will load your image is dependent on a variety of factors, including the visitor’s location. Site Accelerator does not support animated PNGs. Themes and plugins can also use the Photon API to transform images using GET query arguments. Developers will find Photon API examples and documentation on developer. wordpress. com. Site Accelerator is only allowed to be used by sites hosted on WordPress. com or on Jetpack-connected WordPress sites. If you move to another platform or disconnect Jetpack from your site, please also switch to another image CDN service. Any abuse of Jetpack or violation of the WordPress. com Terms of Service could result in the suspension of your site from WordPress. com-connected services, including Site Accelerator. FAQ Can I use your Site Accelerator with audio or video files? Site Accelerator does not serve audio (. mp3, . wav, . flac, etc.) or video (. mp4, . wmv, . flv, etc.) files. If you’d like to host videos on our CDN, check out our Video Hosting feature. How does Site Accelerator determine which dimensions to serve for an image? It looks at the img element’s width and height attributes and then serves an image resized to those dimensions or to the width of the containing element (whichever is smaller). By default, Jetpack will constrain images to the larger of the size indicated when adding the image to a post or to your theme’s “content width” setting. If one isn’t set, Jetpack will default to 1,000px. This is to help ensure that sites are not trying to serve images larger than what the theme intended to be able to display. Is there any way to keep the “width” and “height” attributes in the CDN-generated HTML? We remove the width and height arguments to prevent your images from skewing when the resized image doesn’t have the same dimensions as the original. This is particularly important when you switch from one theme to another, and the new theme might be narrower than the previous one. One of the benefits of this is that we will automatically resize your images so they don’t exceed the width supported by your theme. What happens to my images if I disable Image Accelerator? No worries! Your images will continue to work just fine, they will just start loading from your webhost’s server again instead of ours. Please note that it could take a few minutes for these changes to take place. Once Site Accelerator has been enabled, can I delete the images from my server? No! Your images need to remain on your server for the CDN to work correctly. Any images that are removed from your server will eventually “expire” and be removed from the CDN. I enabled/disabled Site Accelerator and the images are broken As a first step, wait a few moments and then load your site in a completely different web browser than you normally use to make sure it’s not just your browser cache interfering with the URL change. It can take a few minutes for these changes to be reflected on your entire site. Next, check that your Jetpack connection is working properly. Still not working? It is possible that there may be another plugin on your site conflicting with Site Accelerator. Please try to disable all of your plugins except Jetpack, then try checking your images again. If they are displaying properly, we’ll know that another plugin is interfering. You can find out which plugin is the culprit by enabling each plugin one by one and checking images after each one. Finally, if it still isn’t working after disabling your plugins, it may be the theme. To test this, you can switch to one of the default themes such as Twenty Seventeen. If the issue is resolved, then you know it’s a problem with the theme, and you’ll need to contact the theme author for further assistance. No luck? Please reach out to us for more support.

However, XML-RPC support has been built into WordPress core since version 3.5 and is a stable tool. Jetpack, like other plugins, services, and mobile apps, relies on the XML-RPC file to communicate with WordPress. com. If this is blocked, your Jetpack connection will stop working properly. You should be able to protect a site’s XML-RPC file without having to allow specific IP ranges. The most popular hosts use tools like fail2ban or ModSecurity, for example. If you’d prefer to use an allowlist, you’ll need to allow these IP ranges: 122.248.245.244/3254.217.201.243/3254.232.116.4/32192.0.80.0/20192.0.96.0/20192.0.112.0/20195.234.108.0/22 Important: These IP addresses are subject to change. If you are writing IP-based firewall rules, you’ll need to update those rules any time the addresses change. We also have machine-readable versions of these IP ranges in JSON and plain text format that you can use to automate configuration changes on your systems. Using Jetpack with Cloudflare and/or Sucuri By default, Cloudflare and Jetpack should require no additional configuration to operate together if there are no additional security configurations specified with Cloudflare.

Requirements Unlike our Mailchimp Subscriber popup, the Mailchimp Block allows you to collect emails right inside a post or page. You can position it in your content at the exact moment that your readers will be most inclined to sign up. This block is available to all Jetpack sites. Connecting to Mailchimp The first you use the Mailchimp block, you will need to connect your Mailchimp account. Click Set up Mailchimp form to begin. Connect to Mailchimp. This will take you to the Tools → Marketing → Connections section of your WordPress. com account, where you should click Connect in the Mailchimp section: Connect to Mailchimp. You’ll be asked to enter your Mailchimp username and password in a popup window. Once you do that, you’ll see that Mailchimp was successfully connected, but that you need to designate a list that new subscribers should be added to: Connect to Mailchimp. Simply choose a list that you want new subscribers to be added to. (If you do not have any lists yet, Mailchimp has a guide on how to create them.) Back in the Block Editor, you may need to click the Recheck Connection button inside the Mailchimp Block if you added the block before connecting. Mailchimp on Multiple Sites If you have more than one site connected to your WordPress. com account, you only need to set up the Mailchimp connection once, which will work across all sites. Similarly, disconnecting Mailchimp under any site will turn off Mailchimp across all sites on your account. You can create a different list in Mailchimp for each site and then use the specific list in My Site → Marketing → Connections for a specific site. Mailchimp double opt-in The Jetpack Mailchimp block does not currently integrate with Mailchimp’s double opt-in settings. As a result, the following message is displayed in the block: “By clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner. Use the unsubscribe link in those emails to opt-out at any time.” A workaround is creating a form on the Mailchimp site and embedding the form into a page, post, block, or widget on your site as an alternative. You can find the Mailchimp shortcode information here. Adding the Mailchimp Block You can add the Mailchimp Block by selecting it from the Jetpack or Grow section of the block editor: Search the block. The default block content looks like this: Mailchimp block display. Customizing the Mailchimp Block You can customize the text and colors by changing them in the block editor sidebar. Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar and options found in the block toolbar. If you do not see the sidebar, click the Settings icon next to the Publish button. The Mailchimp Block has multiple settings you can adjust in the Block Settings sidebar. Click the downward arrow next to any header in your sidebar to see the additional options for each section. Text Elements The Email Placeholder changes the text shown inside the email field. It disappears once the field is typed in. Notifications There are three messages related to the function of the form that you can modify: The Processing text message shows while an email is added to the list.

Mailchimp Block settings Mailchimp Groups If you’ve created groups of subscribers within your selected list, this is where you can choose which groups to add new signups to.

The groups’ list will only appear if you’ve already created groups in Mailchimp.

Settings Once activated, you can allowlist IP addresses from the same Site Settings page. Allow listing may be necessary if you’ve made too many failed login attempts to your site or Jetpack has detected unusual behavior from your current IP address.

Troubleshooting Have trouble with Brute Force Protection on your site? Check the tips below to find out why. How long is an IP blocked? The length of time is based on a number of factors and is not a set amount of time. Jetpack locked me out. What can I do? If Jetpack has flagged your IP address for any reason it may block you from logging in. In this case, you’ll see something like this: Enter your email address and hit Send. You will receive an email with a special link you can click to regain access to the login form. If you get an error when clicking the link in the email, you can allowlist your IP address as covered under Settings to unblock yourself. If you are still blocked, it’s likely due to a configuration issue on your server. You can disable Brute force protection to regain access to your site. Then contact us for help further troubleshooting. Why am I seeing a math captcha on my login page? The math captcha is used as a fallback for the brute force protection feature. If your IP has been blocked due to too many failed login attempts, you may still access your site by correctly filling out the math captcha along with the correct login credentials. In very rare cases, you might see the captcha if you’ve not obtained an API key or during times of very heavy attacks. Jetpack’s brute force protection is unable to effectively protect your site because your server is misconfigured Whenever someone tries to log in to your site, Jetpack’s Brute force protection feature looks at that person’s IP address and compares it with our global database of malicious IP addresses. For this to work properly, we rely on IP addresses stored and provided by your server. Unfortunately in some cases your server may not return any IP address, thus blocking Protect from working properly. When this happens, the brute force protection feature will be disabled and we will let you know. If that happens, do not hesitate to send a link to this page to your hosting provider, so they can take a look and fix the issue for you. They can also contact us directly via this contact form if they need more information. Brute force protection on Multisite Networks If you tried to log in to your site multiple times but failed to log in because you had forgotten your password, you may end up being blocked by Jetpack’s brute force protection feature. In a WordPress Multisite installation, you can log in to any account that exists on the network through any log in page on the network. As a result, if you have Jetpack’s brute force protection active on some sites but not all, then no site is truly being protected. To address this, please network enable Jetpack on your multisite installation and activate the brute force protection feature on the network’s primary site. Once completed, Jetpack’s brute force protection feature will be activated on every site on your network, even if Jetpack isn’t connected on those sites. Jetpack reports thousands of blocked malicious login attempts The best way to explain this feature is that there are thousands of “bots” out there trying to gain access to sites all over the internet. No matter what size your site is, there’s always someone or something trying to “break in”. WordPress is very secure and usually the weakest point is someone’s password. Bots consequently try to guess people’s passwords to get in. Jetpack’s brute force protection feature collects information from failed attempts from millions of sites and protects you from these attacks. For example, if a bot tried to gain access to site A, and then went to site B, Jetpack’s brute force protection would already know who this bot is and before it even tries to get into site B, it would be blocked. Along with that, it’s also really important to have strong secure passwords. Where can I get more information about the blocked attacks? e. g. Which user names need more securing?Is this via wp-login, or via XMLRPC? From which IP addresses do these arrive?When did these occur? Is there a pattern? If these were found, how many more are there that were not detected? We don’t have access to this information. Jetpack’s brute force protection was built to be lean and simple. It’s built in such a way that you don’t have to think about these questions or make any decisions. As such, the only data we store is the total number of attacks blocked. Privacy Information This feature is activated by default. It can be deactivated at any time by toggling the Brute force protection setting under Jetpack → Settings → Security on your WP Admin dashboard. For general features and FAQs, please see our Jetpack Security features.

As a result, if you have Jetpack’s brute force protection active on some sites but not all, then no site is truly being protected.

Bots consequently try to guess people’s passwords to get in.

For example, if a bot tried to gain access to site A, and then went to site B, Jetpack’s brute force protection would already know who this bot is and before it even tries to get into site B, it would be blocked.

We provide priority support to customers with paid plans and services. This documentation is subject to change and is not comprehensive, as there will always be edge cases that we aren’t able to assist with. If we’re unable to help, we will try to point you in a direction where you can find appropriate assistance. Our products are designed for use with most WordPress sites. If you’re not sure our products are suitable for your site, please reach out to us! We are happy to help you decide if our products are right for you. We do all our support over email. We have found that this is the most efficient way to solve most Jetpack problems, rather than telephone or live chat. Jetpack primarily provides support in English. If you contact us in a different language, we’ll do our best to translate your message and will reply in English. What Jetpack Support Covers We only provide support for our products, including Jetpack, VaultPress, and Akismet. Support includes, but is not necessarily limited to: assistance with installation, standard configuration, and use. We also encourage you to read our support documentation for Jetpack, VaultPress, and Akismet. You may find your question already answered there! Please contact us directly if you encounter any problems during installation, while updating any of our plugins, or if your host has told you one of our products is causing an issue on your site. We are not able to assist with issues related to your web server or host, such as: website optimization, . htaccess rules, site speed or performance, DNS, email delivery or receipt issues, errors not related to our products, SSL certificate and/or HTTPS implementation, firewall setup, crashed / unresponsive sites, or customizations to Jetpack’s code, beyond what is provided in our public support documentation. We can only provide support for sites running Jetpack and WordPress’ minimum supported versions, typically two releases prior to the current version. If you’re not sure if your site is running a supported version, you can check your WordPress version on the Dashboard > Update page in your WP Admin, and your Jetpack version on the Plugins page in WP Admin. During our troubleshooting process, we may require you to disable third-party plugins, or temporarily switch to one of the default WordPress themes before we are able to assist you. This is also to your benefit, because if we find that the issue isn’t related to Jetpack or one of our other products, we can often direct you to the best place to get the issue resolved. For some types of troubleshooting, there may be situations where we will ask permission to log into your WordPress site. However, we’re unable to log into accounts or platforms other than your WP Admin. This includes, but is not limited to: hosting accounts, domain registrar accounts, and cPanel. Known conflicts with Jetpack can be found here, though these may be subject to change, as the WordPress ecosystem is ever-evolving. VaultPress and Jetpack Backup: Backups and Restores We can help you install, connect, and configure VaultPress, and advise on best practices. We can also help you begin a restore and investigate failed backups and restores. In some situations, we may ask you to provide FTP, SFTP, or SSH credentials so we may access your server (with your explicit permission). You are not required to give us these credentials, but we may not be able to troubleshoot some issues without this permitted access. Important note: you do need to add credentials to VaultPress or Jetpack Backup to run a restore of your site, so it’s best to get these credentials added when you initially purchase your plan. We’re unable to configure, troubleshoot, or fix your server configuration, firewalls, or database issues that may interfere with a successful backup or restore. Assistance with manual restores is also outside the scope of support we can offer. VaultPress and Jetpack: Malware Scanning and Security Fixes We can help you understand security threats reported by our security scanner. When a threat is detected, we offer a one-click fix for most problems. In some cases that is not available, in which case we suggest following this guide to cleaning a hacked site. VaultPress and Jetpack are not intended to be a service to clean up already hacked or malware-infected sites. While we can fix some hacked files after purchase, we do rely on the site not being infected at the time of purchase and having a clean version to compare any changed files to. Akismet Spam Protection We can advise on how to install, activate, and register the Akismet plugin with your API key. We can also advise if you or a user on your site is improperly being flagged by Akismet as spam. We are unable to help configure Akismet for integration with third-party plugins and platforms, and we cannot advise on code customization. We do have public, developer-level documentation, which is provided as-is. Some Specifics About Customization A customization is anything that changes the way Jetpack, Jetpack Backup, VaultPress, or Akismet looks or functions. Each of our products are provided as-is. While we can help you configure our products within the intended capability and function of each plugin, we do not assist with the customization of our products, nor can we help troubleshoot custom code, or officially endorse third-party customization solutions. There are many resources available on the web if you would like to hire a WordPress developer or designer. We provide some customization snippets in our documentation: for example, customizing Related Posts. These tutorials are also provided as-is, and we strongly recommend backing up your site before implementing any custom code. For those comfortable working with code, we offer Jetpack Developer Documentation, which is also provided as-is. We are not able to assist with cosmetic changes to your site. This includes, but is not limited to: theme design or advice, custom CSS code, menu structure, and color or font changes. For themes included with Jetpack, each theme has detailed documentation on WordPress. com, and we can provide general answers to basic configuration questions related to this documentation. Support Channels and Reporting Issues When an issue is brought to our attention, we will first ensure that it is reproducible. Then, we escalate it to our developers to pursue a fix where possible and appropriate. You can help expedite this process by providing us with screenshots and detailed steps to reproduce the problem. The more specific, the better! The public Jetpack repository on GitHub can be found here. From that repository, you can view known issues. Your issue may have already been identified! If you’ve discovered something new, please feel free to create a new issue. You can find our recommendations on how to write a great GitHub issue here. For enhancement requests, please be as specific as possible about what you’d like to see. Contacting Support We encourage all Jetpack users to reach out for support.

To use Pay with PayPal, your site must have an active Jetpack Security or Complete plan. To make the block work, we need to integrate with third-party cloud services (such as the PayPal API), send notification emails and summaries, and store tokens and API keys in a PCI-compliant manner. Adding a Pay with PayPal block You can add a Pay with PayPal block to any post or page by selecting it from the Earn section of the block picker: See our Jetpack Blocks page for more information on adding Jetpack blocks. The following short video shows the full process of adding a Pay with PayPal block to a post: Select the Pay with PayPal block from the Jetpack section of the Block Picker. Add an image for the product or good you’re selling. Enter the name of the item. Enter a brief description of the item. Select your currency and enter the price (without a currency symbol). Select whether to allow people to buy more than one item at a time. Enter your PayPal email address. The email address you enter will determine where PayPal sends payments for the items sold or donations collected. Double-check the email address you enter to be sure it’s valid and belongs to you! You’ll also need a free PayPal account linked to your bank account to claim any payments you receive. By repeating the process above, you can add as many Pay with PayPal blocks as you like to your page. Taking Payments with PayPal Please note that your Jetpack-powered site must be public to accept payments and use the Pay with PayPal feature. Private sites cannot accept payments via PayPal. When a visitor clicks the Pay with PayPal button, a new window will open to guide them through the PayPal checkout process. Visitors can use an existing PayPal account or a credit or debit card to complete their purchase. All payments are credited to the PayPal account linked to the email address used in the button. For every purchase, PayPal will send you a confirmation email with the customer or donor’s information. The customer will also receive an email from PayPal as a receipt for the purchase. If the email you use is not linked to an existing PayPal account and your bank, you will receive an email from PayPal with information about claiming any collected payments. This email is sent after you receive your first payment. Finally, you will also receive an email from Jetpack when a purchase is completed, as well as a monthly report for all your Pay with PayPal buttons. Privacy Information This feature is deactivated by default, and unlocking it requires an upgrade to the Security or Complete plan.

This plan type can use the inline search widget or the instant search overlay and includes spelling correction. Pricing for current and legacy Jetpack Search plans and bundles that contain Jetpack Search. Frequently Asked Questions How can I reduce the number of records on my site? If you have particular post types on your site that you never want to count as a record and you don’t need other Jetpack features to work on that post type, then you can completely exclude it from being synced. You can add this code to a functionality plugin: add_action( 'plugins_loaded', 'filter_blacklisted_post_types' ); public function filter_blacklisted_post_types() { if ( class_exists( '\\Automattic\\Jetpack\\Sync\\Settings' ) ) { // Get current blacklist $blacklist = \\Automattic\\Jetpack\\Sync\\Settings::get_setting('post_types_blacklist'); //Check if post type is in blacklist if ( ! in_array( 'topic', $blacklist ) ) { // Append post_type to blacklist $blacklist[] = 'XXXXX' $settings = [ 'post_types_blacklist' => $blacklist ]; // Update settings \\Automattic\\Jetpack\\Sync\\Settings::update_settings( $settings ); } } } It is not possible to exclude individual content from being indexed other than making it publicly inaccessible. Will the search stop working if I go beyond my maximum number of records and/or monthly search requests? Jetpack Search (purchased before November 14, 2022) A few weeks before your next billing cycle you will get an email informing you that you are over your limit and telling you what you will be charged when you auto-renew. This gives you time to reduce the number of records or just let the auto-renewal take place. If you are on an annual plan then your price will go up at most once a year. For monthly plans, we will check your record count every month before your plan is renewed. For Jetpack Search (purchased on or after November 14, 2022) A few weeks before your next billing cycle you will get an email informing you that you are over your limit and telling you what you will be charged when you auto-renew. This gives you time to reduce the number of records or just let the auto-renewal take place. For users on the Jetpack Search free tier, if you exceed your limit for three consecutive months and choose not to upgrade, Jetpack Search will be turned off and your site will default to the standard WordPress search. There will be no action for you to take for the site to change back to the default WordPress search, as it is packaged with the WordPress core software. I have the Jetpack Professional Plan, how is this different? The main difference between the Jetpack Professional plan and the newer Jetpack Search plans is that you will not have access to the Instant Search overlay feature and the search relevancy is not as good. If you are using Jetpack Search via the Jetpack Professional plan, we recommend the following: Enable Search from within wp-admin. The setting is under Jetpack → Settings → Performance. You can also enable this from your WordPress. com dashboard. Replace the standard Search widget with the Jetpack Search widget. This is optional but without it, you will not have access to the additional sort options or filtering. If you aren’t seeing any results on your site, the index may not be ready yet. You can force the index to update by manually synchronizing your site with WordPress. com, which can be done from your connection settings. Why did you change the pricing model? There were two reasons why we changed our pricing model: Many folks were only looking for Search and did not want to also be paying for features they didn’t need. Allowing an unlimited number of records felt unfair because it was preventing us from offering lower prices or making improvements. Our operating costs for a site with one million posts are much higher than for a site with one thousand posts, but both sites were paying the same amount. We also wanted to offer users a free option so that they can experience how great Jetpack Search is before making a commitment to buy. The new pricing makes Jetpack Search more affordable for small sites and still costs big sites less than the competition. It’s also available as a single product, so there’s no need to pay for other features you may not need just to use Jetpack Search.

I have the Jetpack Professional Plan, how is this different? The main difference between the Jetpack Professional plan and the newer Jetpack Search plans is that you will not have access to the Instant Search overlay feature and the search relevancy is not as good.

There were two reasons why we changed our pricing model: Many folks were only looking for Search and did not want to also be paying for features they didn’t need. Allowing an unlimited number of records felt unfair because it was preventing us from offering lower prices or making improvements. Our operating costs for a site with one million posts are much higher than for a site with one thousand posts, but both sites were paying the same amount.

The main difference between the Jetpack Professional and the newer Jetpack Search plans is that you will not have access to the Instant Search overlay feature.

It’s also available as a single product, so there’s no need to pay for other features you may not need just to use Jetpack Search. Troubleshooting The search box in my theme is not opening the overlay Some themes do not use the standard get_search_form() function to render their search box. First, verify that the Search is working correctly on your site by adding a search query to the end of your site URL. For instance, if your site is mysite. com, then navigate to mysite. com?s=searchterm. If that works, then there are a few options: Contact your theme’s author and ask them to add support for Jetpack Search. We try to attach to search boxes in many different ways. Add a search box to your theme yourself. Add a button to your site that will open the search overlay. Some of my content is missing from search results. When Jetpack is first connected it can sometimes take hours or days to fully sync all data depending on how many records you have. If the number of results when you have not done a search is still going up every few minutes, then it is likely that data is still being synchronized. When you first purchase Search, we also need to build your search index, which can take a while, though it is much faster than doing a full sync. Jetpack Search limits the number of characters to 30,000 when indexing. There are some common problems that sites do have, though: Custom post types can be publicly available but be set to not be searchable. This happens when exclude_from_search it is set to true when registering the post type. Content is directly imported into the database. If you are regularly importing content and not triggering the WordPress hooks, then Jetpack will not synchronize the data. A good hook to use is publish_post. Using post_status other than publish. We only index and search against posts that have the post_status of either publish or closed (for bbpress). If you change any of the above, you will need to fully sync your site. To do so: Log in to WordPress. com. Under “My Sites” navigate to Manage → Settings → General → Site Tools → Manage your connection. Under “Data synchronization,” click on “initiate a sync manually.” In addition to the above, Jetpack skips indexing the following post types by default: revision scheduled-action nbcs_video_lookup reply (as used by bbPress) product_variation (as used by WooCommerce) nav_menu_item (doesn’t make sense to index this) My custom taxonomy is never being displayed. If you have configured a custom taxonomy in your sidebar widget, but it is never being shown, it is possible that your taxonomy is not yet supported. We have a fixed list of custom taxonomies that we index (a bit more than 1,000). We can add to the list, but would prefer to do so only for generic words and names. If you would like to suggest a term to add, you can open an issue on our GitHub repository. Alternatively, you can add custom taxonomies via a filter. Searches are not matching against content in post meta We have a list of post meta keys that we match against. We are still working on improving the process for adding new taxonomies and post meta fields. In the stats dashboard, search terms are not showing up The Jetpack stats dashboard does not record the terms your readers use when using the search form on your site (or any other search forms on your site). They collect stats from search engines instead – more on that here. How do I search against multilingual content with the WPML or Polylang plugins? We do not currently support multiple languages on the same site. We hope to add support soon, but in the meantime, you can check this status in this public-facing GitHub Issue. How do I only show results from certain post types (e. g. products) This code filter will filter all search queries so only results from products and pages are shown. This does not impact the number of indexed records (see below). function jp_filter_query( $options ) { $options['adminQueryFilter'] = array( 'bool' => array( 'should' => array( array( 'term' => array( 'post_type' => product' ) ), array( 'term' => array( 'post_type' => page ) ), ) ) ); return $options; } add_filter( 'jetpack_instant_search_options', 'jp_filter_query' ); How do I remove all posts/pages with a certain category This filter will remove all posts/pages with the “removeme” category from search results.

It is a paid upgrade to the Jetpack plugin that provides higher quality results and an improved search experience. Upgrade today to get started. This support article covers how to customize Jetpack Search by using the Jetpack Search API and is intended for developers. By default Jetpack Search will search everything to provide the best result. All records/documents (posts, pages, products, etc) on your site are searchable and will potentially be shown to end users. When sites are more complex though, you may want to limit the search based on what part of the site the user is currently on. Additionally, the API could be used to build features into a website or an app to provide better content discovery experiences. The Jetpack Search engine combines data from multiple sources (your WordPress database and your stats/analytics) and indexes it into Elasticsearch. All search queries are Elasticsearch queries, though the engine will sometimes run multiple queries to get the best results. The API allows a subset of the Elasticsearch Query DSL and Aggregations to be used for filtering and aggregating on the search results. If you have a request, our Github issues are always open.

The Elasticsearch project does not maintain the same level of backwards compatibility and we intend to shield our customers from needing to do unnecessary work. There are also some features of Elasticsearch that do not scale well or can cause performance problems when used. By limiting the available queries, we hope to find the right balance between maintenance and flexibility. What version of Elasticsearch are you running?

Diagnosing Issues With SSL Certificates One of the first signs that there’s a problem with the certificate on your site is when you or others see an error just trying to visit your site, usually mentioning that “your connection is not private” or there’s a “potential security risk ahead.” When these happen, you can check for more detailed errors on your SSL certificate with this SSL Checker and test its overall health with this SSL Server Test (It should typically be graded A or A+). Server Misconfiguration These problems happen when the server is set up to use an older, less secure encryption method that’s not supported by modern web browsers or when the certificate simply doesn’t exist. In cases like these, you should reach out to your webhost to have them reinstall the certificate and ensure that they have the most updated encryption method applied when they serve it. Certificates are Incorrect or Expired These are caused by issues with the certificates themselves. They were not generated properly or the existing ones that once worked were not renewed for the year. Expired Certificate Error example: Certificate has expired Just like a domain, an SSL certificate needs to be renewed each year or it will expire. Certificate renewals usually happen without you having to do anything, but sometimes automatic systems at your webhost may fail to do it. You’ll need to contact your webhost and ask them to renew the current certificate or install a new one. Here’s a detailed guide on how to install a free SSL certificate. Self-Signed Certificate Error examples: Self signed certificate / Self signed certificate in certificate chain The certificate was not created by using standard security practices and is considered unsafe. Have your webhost add a fully trusted certificate to your site. There are usually different options that they can offer, both paid and free. Name Matches Error example: No alternative certificate subject name matches target host name Most hosting providers share a large server between multiple sites. If your site doesn’t have an SSL certificate assigned to it, the server can return a default certificate under the host’s domain instead of yours, causing the browser to believe there is a security issue because it doesn’t match your site. When this happens, your host needs to reinstall your SSL certificate. Miscellaneous Errors Error examples: Unable to get local issuer certificate / EE certificate key too weak / SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:tlsv1 alert internal error / SSL routines:tls12_check_peer_sigalg:wrong signature type Basically, any time you see a random error regarding a certificate on your site, the next best step is to reach out to your webhost. Issues like these usually relate to the hosting configuration itself. Trouble With Your Device Error example: Net::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID In these modern days where everything is set to update automatically, this rarely happens, but being able to identify it can save you a ton of troubleshooting time. The two biggest causes for this error are using a web browser that hasn’t been updated in quite a long time (try updating your browser and restarting it to see if that helps), and your device’s clock being set incorrectly (check to see if your date and time are correct and make sure it’s set to automatically sync).","length":3551,"tokens":737,"chunks":[{"title":"Fixing the Most Common SSL Certificate Errors","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/fixes-for-most-common-ssl-certificate-errors/","content":"Fixing the Most Common SSL Certificate Errors Your SSL certificate makes sure the traffic on your site is safe and secure.

If you use Jetpack Scan to monitor your site, it will notify you of any potential threats. In many cases, these can be resolved with the click of a button. However, sometimes a website can get hacked more severely, meaning a “one-click” fix is not possible. Jetpack Scan is not intended to be a service to clean up already hacked or malware-infected sites. While we can possibly fix some already hacked files after a plan is bought, we do rely on the site not being infected at the time of purchase and having a clean version to compare any changed files to. This article will help guide you through the process of identifying and cleaning up a hacked site, as well as strengthening the site’s security to help prevent future hacks. How to tell if your site has been hacked The first step is confirming that your site has really been hacked, and isn’t just experiencing a more easily resolved error. The following issues are a good indication that your site has been hacked: Your site is redirecting to another website with malicious or spammy content Your site contains links to spam sites, which you did not add, and you can’t remove them You find pages on your site that you don’t recognize via a Google search Google shows warnings for your site, such as “This site may be hacked,” “Deceptive site ahead,” “The site ahead contains malware,” etc. You scan your site with a tool such as Jetpack Scan, and it detects security threats which can’t be resolved automatically You can check if Google currently lists your site as unsafe with their Safe Browsing Site Status tool Cleaning a hacked site If you’re sure your site has been hacked, you can follow these steps to resolve the issue: 1. Contact your hosting provider Your host should be the first port of call, as they may be aware of a wider issue, especially if you are on shared hosting. In most cases, your host may be able to deal with the issue for you, saving you a lot of work. 2. Restore from a backup If you have a backup of your site from before it was hacked, either from your host or with a dedicated backup service like Jetpack Backup, then restoring to that point may do the trick. However, if the hack lies within files that aren’t included in the backup, then the issue may remain even after restoring the site. It’s also worth noting that you could lose content added after the point you’re restoring to, so this may not be an ideal option and should be a last resort. 3. Cleaning hacked files If your host is unable to assist, and restoring the site is not an option, then it’s time to do some detective work to find the source of the problem. Make sure you have a full backup of your site before starting this, as removing/editing your site’s files can make for even more work if something goes wrong. First, check the results of any malware plugins or services you’re using. They may provide a list of suspicious files, which is a good starting point. WordPress core files If the affected file(s) are part of WordPress core, you can compare the code to a clean download from WordPress. org and remove any code that doesn’t belong there. Another option is to completely reinstall WordPress to ensure all core files are clean. You can do that via Dashboard > Updates, by clicking ‘Re-install now.’ It sounds scary, but this will only replace the files at the very core of WordPress and will not remove or replace any of your content, media, themes, or plugins. Themes If the infection is a part of a theme, you can install a fresh copy if you’re using it or uninstall the theme completely if you’re not using it. If you’re unable to clear the threat through this method, you should contact your theme’s developer for guidance. Plugins If the problem lies within a plugin, you can also install a fresh copy or delete it if you’re not using it as with the theme process above. For advanced users, you can determine if a plugin installed or downloaded from the WordPress. org Plugin Repository has a threat in it by following these instructions: Check which file is affected Click “Edit this file” to see that plugin’s code Copy the URL slug of plugin (e. g. “code-snippets”) Search for that plugin’s slug on WordPress. org Go to Plugin > Development > Browse the code Find “Tags” Open tag matching your installed plugin version Locate the correct file and download it Open the file in a text editor Use “Find” and copy/paste the entire code from step 2 and search If the code matches the plugin’s code from the WordPress. org Plugin Repository, you have a false positive and the plugin is working as intended! If not, we recommend consulting with an expert who can clean the site safely. If the plugin is not in the Repository, you can contact the plugin’s developer and have them check the code identified as malicious by Jetpack Scan. Not sure what the file is? If you don’t understand the purpose of the affected files, you may need to consult an expert who can help you clean the site safely. If you want to explore further and learn how to clean up various types of hacks, Google has an in-depth guide to cleaning hacked sites. Tightening security after cleaning your hacked site Once your site is free from malware, it’s important to follow these steps to secure your site, as failing to do so may leave your site open to another hack from the same point of vulnerability. 1. Make sure WordPress and all of your themes and plugins are kept updated Outdated plugins, themes, and WordPress files are an extremely common source of vulnerability. Keeping them all updated to the latest version is one of the best ways to protect your site and keep it running efficiently. Also, be sure to fully uninstall any themes or plugins you are not using. 2. Reset all passwords In case any of your passwords have been compromised, you should change your password for everything you can think of, including your: Hosting account Email accounts Website’s admin accounts FTP/SFTP/SSH credentials Database passwords The password to unlock any device you’ve edited your site with Make sure you use a strong and unique password for each site, device, or program to avoid a domino effect if one is ever compromised. 3. Audit your site’s user accounts Check your user list via Users > All Users inside your site’s dashboard and make sure there aren’t any administrator accounts that you don’t recognize. Remove any suspicious user accounts. 4. Update your WordPress secret keys Your site’s wp-config. php file contains secret keys/”salts” which are used for encryption. You should generate new secret keys and replace the old ones in that file. Your webhost may have an automatic tool on their side to do this. 5. Scan your site regularly The measures above will help keep your site safe, but nothing is 100% guaranteed, so you should use an automated scanning service such as Jetpack Scan to make sure you are alerted of any future security threats so you can deal with them quickly. Removing your site from “unsafe” lists If your site is listed as unsafe by Google, then Google will likely still show warnings about your site even after the hacked files have been cleaned or even removed. To get that warning lifted, you’ll need to request a review of your site. McAfee SiteAdvisor has a similar service that rates a website’s reputation. If your site is listed as unsafe there after cleaning it up, you can submit a dispute request.","length":7517,"tokens":1670,"chunks":[{"title":"How to Clean Your Hacked WordPress Site","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/scan/how-to-clean-your-hacked-wordpress-site/","content":"How to Clean Your Hacked WordPress Site Having your website hacked can be scary and stressful, but it needn’t be a disaster.

Can I use VideoPress to host videos on my own server? No. When video hosting is active, videos are uploaded straight to the WordPress. com cloud. They are intentionally not hosted on your own server to avoid any storage or upload limits enforced by your hosting provider. My upload dies before it finishes. A slow or unreliable Internet connection can further limit the size of the video you can upload. Try uploading at a different time of day or from a computer with a faster internet connection. Keep trying (don’t worry, failed attempts do not count against your storage space limit). If your uploads are timing out, try uploading a video from the WordPress. com dashboard – https://wordpress. com/media/videos/. This should ensure that no hosting upload limits or site upload limits come into play. For best results, we recommend uploading videos meeting the specifications outlined on this page. We also recommend File Sizes 1 GB and Lower: Jetpack’s video hosting may work for files up to 5 GB in size, but the larger the file is, the greater chance for the process to fail. Most networks will time out before you’re able to upload a file that’s larger than 1.4 GB. We cannot support files that are larger than 5 GB. Can I change the default thumbnail image for my video? Yes. Follow these steps: Go to https://wordpress. com/media/videos/ for the site that contains the videos. Select the video of interest and click Edit. In the video editor, click Edit Thumbnail. Wait for a desirable frame and “Select Frame”. Done! Your thumbnail image (also known as a poster frame) is updated automatically. What happens to my videos if don’t renew my plan? Your videos will no longer be viewable, but will not be deleted. Renewing the plan will instantly enable the videos for viewing again. If you’ve embedded videos using a shortcode, you will need to enable shortcode embeds for the videos to continue to display on your site. What is the format of the video being played? Jetpack converts your uploaded video file into the HLS streaming format (with fragmented MP4). Our MP4 files are encoded with H.264 video and AAC audio lossy compression codecs. We stream HLS playlists. HLS/MPD(MPEG DASH) are HTTP-based streaming protocols. What kind of video content can I upload? Any videos uploaded to Jetpack’s video hosting service are subject to WordPress. com’s content policies. The exclusions on this mature content page apply to videos as well. My video is only available at standard resolution after uploading? Why? If a video is longer than three hours and greater than 1GB, we don’t encode the 480p, 720p, or 1080p files, due to storage space limitations. All of my videos are showing as private. You may need to reconnect Jetpack as VideoPress requires an active Jetpack connection to serve your videos. Video embeds aren’t working. Make sure sharing is enabled on the embedded video. Sharing needs to be enabled for video embeds to work. Can I access a VideoPress video through the API? You can’t access a VideoPress video through the API.

My other Administrators on my site aren’t able to upload any videos. When a site doesn’t have the Jetpack plugin installed and you are only using the VideoPress plugin, additional admins will need to connect via My Jetpack before they will be able to upload any videos.

Learn some basic troubleshooting steps you can take to fix backup issues. Check the Site’s Jetpack Connection A working Jetpack connection is required to get Jetpack VaultPress Backup working properly. Before attempting any other troubleshooting steps, make sure your site’s Jetpack connection is working. The Jetpack connection is used to facilitate backups of your site. There are times when the connection can become unstable or broken. This may be due to a misconfiguration of your site or hosting. The first thing to do is check the connection status using the Jetpack Debug page. If it reports any issues with the connection, please see the Fixing Jetpack Connection Issues guide. Check your site’s connection on the Jetpack Debug page. Troubleshoot the connection using the Fixing Jetpack Connection Issues guide. Add Server Credentials Once the Jetpack connection is working, that should be enough for backups to start working again. In some situations, your site may still run into errors. In that case, the next step is to add server credentials. An added bonus to adding server credentials is that backups are more efficient, and you are set to perform site restores in the event that you ever need one. Adding the credentials is done differently depending on which Jetpack plugin you’re using. See these guides for more information: Adding Credentials in the Jetpack Plugin Adding Credentials to the Jetpack VaultPress Backup Plugin Check File Permissions Ensure your SFTP/SSH/FTP credentials have full read and write file permissions to the files listed on your Backup Warnings list. After fixing the issue, you can wait for the new backup to run the next day, or trigger a new backup by clicking the ‘Retry’ button on your Backup page. Transients errors You can fix transient file errors by adding a donotbackup folder and moving the files listed on your Backup Warnings list to this folder. After fixing the issue, you can wait for the new backup to run the next day, or trigger a new backup by clicking the ‘Retry’ button on your Backup page. Database errors Ensure your database credentials have proper access to your database and your tables are not corrupt. After fixing the issue, you can wait for the new backup to run the next day, or trigger a new backup by clicking the ‘Retry’ button on your Backup page. Review Security and Proxy Settings Even with a working Jetpack connection and server credentials, we can still see failed backups. An example would be a proxy service like Cloudflare blocking SSH/FTP connections or a security plugin like Wordfence blocking certain network requests. If you are comfortable, feel free to review and customize these settings. If not, we recommend temporarily disabling these services/features while troubleshooting your backups. Generally, this can be achieved by disabling the plugin but you might also have to disable a feature in the service providers dashboard (ie: pausing Cloudflare from their dashboard). Speak to Your Host Even when everything has been set up correctly it’s still possible to see errors. This is usually due to security settings outside your control. Examples of this would be hosts who run ModSecurity at a level above what the hosting control panel exposes. Often this type of security is automated and kicks in temporarily when the server sees repeated requests from a certain IP or too many requests in a given window of time. The best way to get around this is to have your host allowlist Jetpack. You can direct them to our Hosting Reference Documentation page for the necessary details. See the section titled, “Allowlist IPs”. If you are not sure about who your site is hosted with you can check using WhoIsHostingThis. com. Some security and firewall plugins may also block requests from Jetpack; adding the same IP ranges to these plugins may be required. You could also try temporarily disabling other plugins to determine which may be blocking requests. No Longer Need Backups? If your plans for your site have changed and you no longer need backups, you can cancel your Jetpack plan so you won’t receive these emails anymore.

Before looking at restore options, it’s worth considering whether a restore is actually the best solution! It’s possible that your site could be brought back online quickly without resorting to waiting for a restore to complete. Retrace Your Steps Are you aware of any recent changes you made on the site that might have caused the problem? For example, if you recently installed a plugin, it may have had an error or conflict upon activation that caused the site to go down. You can review the site’s Activity Log to check for any recent changes that may have created the issue. If you suspect that a plugin is the cause, you can deactivate that plugin via FTP access or your webhost’s file manager by changing the name of the plugin’s folder inside the /wp-content/plugins/ directory on your server – Your host can help you with that if need be. If you’re not sure whether a plugin is actually to blame, it’s worth testing by deactivating all plugins. If that brings the site back online, then you can try activating each plugin one by one until the site goes down again to determine which one is making trouble. Nervous about deactivating plugins on your live site when testing? Feel free to try out the Health Check & Troubleshooting plugin to create a special session only for you (as a logged-in user) where it starts you off with plugins disabled and a minimal theme applied. Do You See Any Error Messages? When a site is down, it will usually display an error message that can provide a clue as to how to fix it. If you see an error message on the site, check if the error is mentioned on this list of common WordPress errors. If so, follow the guide to see if you can remove the error. If you can’t fix it, definitely copy the error and paste it somewhere or take a screenshot to reference later if you have to. If you see nothing but a blank screen, that may be what’s known as the ‘White Screen of Death’ (WSOD). In this case, you can follow this guide to try and bring the site back.

Most sites that activate this see an increase in traffic. Unlike many other related post plugins, we do all the analysis, processing, and serving from our cloud, so there is no additional load on your server. That’s why Jetpack Related Posts are allowed on web hosts even when similar plugins are banned. Note: This page describes how to use Related Posts when using the Classic Editor plugin. You can find instructions for using Related Posts with the Block Editor here. To start using Related Posts, go to Jetpack → Settings → Traffic page and activate “Show related content after posts”. Related Posts in the Classic Editor If you’re using the Classic Editor, Related Posts will display after your post content. You can opt to display a “Related” header to better separate the section from the end of your post — just activate the “Highlight related content with a heading” option. You can also choose whether you’d like to include the thumbnail or not. If you’d prefer to display only links, you can disable “Show a thumbnail image where available”. For further customization options, please read the Customize Related Posts page. General Information Related content will not appear unless we think we can show at least 3 good results (to avoid simply cross-linking posts with one another). Related content is automatically generated based on the content of the post and any tags or categories if they exist. This feature uses the WordPress. com infrastructure and mirrors your content there for indexing. If you see intermittent issues only affecting certain posts, you can request a reindex of your site by clicking on initiate a sync manually under Data synchronization, at the bottom of your WordPress. com Settings → General → Manage connection page. Related Posts for a given article are cached for 12 hours. Details on Related Post Thumbnails A post’s featured image will appear as the thumbnail. If you haven’t set a featured image for the post, we will look for slideshows and galleries, and then for any images that may be attached to the post. If we don’t find any image attached to that post, we’ll look for single images you may have inserted in the post. If you’ve inserted an image that is hosted on another site, we can use it too, provided it includes width and height parameters that can inform Jetpack about the image size. (If no such parameters exist, Jetpack has no way of knowing if the images will be big enough, and thus they are ignored.) Thumbnails are resized and cropped automatically using the Jetpack image CDN to be 350px wide by 200px tall (1.75:1 ratio) to allow for a consistent visual display. Since this is done automatically, there’s no way to fine-tune where the image is cropped. However, you can change the size of the cropped image by using the jetpack_relatedposts_filter_thumbnail_size filter. Privacy Information This feature is deactivated by default.

Markdown is used by writers and bloggers who want a quick and easy way to write rich text without having to take their hands off the keyboard and without learning a lot of complicated codes and shortcuts. You can use Markdown on your Jetpack-powered blog for posts, pages, and comments. This document will detail how to enable Markdown on your blog and write with it. If you are already familiar with Markdown, just enable it on your blog and start writing; refer to the WordPress. com Markdown Quick Reference page for help. Jetpack uses Markdown Extra, which adds some features not originally available in Markdown. For best results, please use the Text tab in the Editor as the Visual editor can give unexpected results. See below for more details. This guide only applies to posts created with the Classic Editor. See the Jetpack Markdown Block support guide for more information. Enabling Markdown From the Jetpack page in your Dashboard, go to Settings → Writing and activate the “Write posts or pages in plain-text Markdown syntax” option in the Composing section. Enable Markdown. Once activated, Markdown is enabled for posts and pages and is available to all users on your blog. To enable Markdown for comments, go to Settings → Discussion → Comments in your dashboard, and toggle the option labeled Enable Markdown use for comments. Click on Save Settings to apply. Visitors to your blog will now be able to compose comments using Markdown. Enabling Markdown for comments Writing with Markdown Markdown uses special characters and punctuation marks to indicate styles and links. The specific characters you use and how you place them in the document are key to how your document will be formatted. Markdown converts these special characters to the appropriate formatting when the document is published. For best results, use the Text tab in the Editor. The Visual Editor can produce unexpected results. For example, in Markdown, to emphasize a word, you wrap it with an asterisk on both ends, like this: *emphasized*. When your writing is published, it will look like this: emphasized. Similarly, two asterisks denote strong text: **strong** will be published as strong. To indicate links, use regular and square parentheses. Wrap the text you want to link in square parentheses; immediately after it, insert the link target, wrapped in regular parentheses. The actual Markdown could look like this: [Jetpack. com](https://jetpack. com/). When published, it will be a standard link: Jetpack. com. On the left: using Markdown to compose a post in the fullscreen editor. On the right: The published post. The original Markdown text you write will always remain in Markdown, so you can go back and edit it using Markdown. Only the published document – the post or the page – will be converted. If you write a post in Markdown, it will be published as a fully formatted post on your blog, but when you go back and edit, it’ll still be in Markdown. The best way to get started with Markdown is to experiment. Open the Markdown Quick Reference guide, start a draft post on your blog, and try to use the different features. Markdown Extra and Markdown in Jetpack Jetpack uses Markdown Extra by Michel Fortin. It includes features not originally available in Markdown, including improved support for inline HTML, code blocks, tables, and more. Code blocks can use three or more backticks (```), as well as tildes (~~~). See the WordPress. com Markdown Quick Reference page for the most useful formatting and features offered by Markdown Extra. For more detailed information, see the original reference guide for Markdown and the Markdown Extra page. However, the Markdown block currently follows the CommonMark spec. For more information, you can refer to the official CommonMark spec. About Markdown Markdown was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004 as a solution for easily composing richly formatted text on the web. It employs plain text only and is based on conventions established in the computer and technology industry for writing emails and other documents with limited resources. In plain text documents, the text you see on the screen represents all the information in the file, with no formatting or other data hidden from view. Plain text documents have been used for decades for their simplicity, portability, and reliability. You can probably still open and edit any plain text document from the past 40 years on any computing device available today. Markdown has seen popular adoption on the web since it was first introduced, and it is now included in many sites and software programs. Markdown Project. Markdown on Wikipedia.

How to Create a Contact Form While editing a post or page, click the Add Contact Form button. Note: If you do not see the Add Contact Form button, you need to turn on the Contact Form feature. The form will be inserted directly into your content: Handling the Form Results You will receive an email notification for each contact form response (provided your WordPress email sending is working). All responses will also be listed in the Feedback section of the site’s WP Admin. Click on the form and choose the pencil icon to edit it: There, you can adjust all of the form’s settings, including the email address it’s sent to, the subject, and all form fields: If you have the Akismet plugin installed and activated and have an active subscription, every form submission will be checked for spam. Adding a Contact Form with Shortcodes You can add a basic contact form using a WordPress specific code called a shortcode. You can read more about shortcodes here. To add a contact form using a shortcode, copy and paste the text below to any post, page, or text widget: [contact-form] [contact-field label=\"Name\" type=\"name\" required=\"true\" /] [contact-field label=\"Email\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Your Email Address\" required=\"true\" /] [contact-field label=\"Website\" type=\"url\" /] [contact-field label=\"Comment\" type=\"textarea\" required=\"true\" /] [/contact-form] You can find more details and the full list of available contact for shortcode attributes here. Pre-fill Form Fields with URL Parameters You can create custom links to send visitors to a form that is pre-filled with default information. To do this, you’ll need to get the name of the form field, which will include the post or page ID and the field name that you assigned in the form editor. To create a link: Create the form, as described above. Open the page/post containing the form and use your browser’s Element Inspector to locate the field ID of the field you want to pre-fill. It will look something like this: id=\"g12249-name\" Now you can append that field to the URL for the form page, and add the pre-filled entry by adding a ? after the URL and an = after the field ID, followed by the entry. So it will look something like this: https://yourjetpack. blog/contact-form?g12249-name=Jetpack If you’d like to pre-fill multiple fields, you can use & between fields: https://yourjetpack. blog/contact-form?g12249-name=Jetpack&g12249-name=support@jetpack. com You can then use this link wherever you like, and anyone who clicks it will see the pre-filled form rather than the default form. The form functionality will remain the same. Tips for Using Your Form Add to Pages, Posts, or Widgets. Contact forms can be added to pages or posts, or if you copy the generated code, you can add your contact form to a text widget. Forms are customizable. Contact forms can be customized. You can add and remove fields, choose which fields are required, change the email address, or change the subject settings. The form’s appearance can be further customized with CSS. Edit an existing form. To edit an existing form, edit the post or page from WP Admin, then click “Add Contact Form.” One per page – Each post, page, and text widget will only display one contact form. One per page. Each post, page, and text widget will only display one contact form. Remember, email is not secure. Do not use contact forms for sensitive information like credit card numbers, as the information will be transmitted by email. Built-in spam filter. We filter submissions through Akismet to fight spam, then add them to your feedback menu, which is accessible to Editors and Administrators on your site. We also email a copy to you. Customization Customize the Submit Button. The following shows how to customize the submit button by editing the shortcode content: [contact-form submit_button_text='YOUR CUSTOM SUBMIT BUTTON TEXT HERE'] [contact-field label='Name' type='name' required='1'/] [contact-field label='Email' type='email' required='1'/] [contact-field label='Website' type='url'/] [contact-field label='Comment' type='textarea' required='1'/] [/contact-form] Customize the Notification Emails. Jetpack allows you to customize the fields you add to the contact form, and also offers an option to change the subject of the email sent to you after each form submission. You can add tokens to the subject field, like {city}, and Jetpack will replace the token with the value of the “City” form field (case insensitive, just make sure that the words match). Troubleshooting I don’t see the form interface, I only see code! If you don’t see the form interface described above, make sure that you’re in the editor’s Visual tab and not the Text tab, from the top-right of the editor. If you don’t see the Visual and Text tabs as described, go to Users > Your Profile in your site’s Dashboard and uncheck “Disable the visual editor when writing.” The form interface will only work in the editor’s Visual tab. I’m not receiving notification emails about my form submissions! Jetpack, like other contact form plugins, uses a function named wp_mail() to send out emails. It’s the same function that is used by WordPress to send you comment notifications or notifications about new users registering on your site. You can check if that function works properly by leaving a comment on your site and checking if you receive an email. Another alternative would be to use the Email Logs plugin. This plugin records a log of all e-mails sent out by WordPress once it is activated. If an email is listed in this plugin’s logs and you do NOT receive it, then the issue is likely either with your server or the recipient’s server. If you find issues with that function, you could use an SMTP plugin to configure your WordPress installation to use a specific email service to send out emails. If the function appears to work properly, it means that Jetpack’s emails are being filtered out before they can reach your inbox. A few possibilities: They can be filtered out by your server before they even get sent out. Your hosting provider should be able to check their server email logs to find out if the emails were blocked. They can be filtered out by your email provider. If you don’t find the emails in your spam folder, you’ll want to try sending out Jetpack emails to another email address and see if you keep experiencing issues. If none of this helps, contact support for assistance.

So, any posts or pages you’ve added since the date of the restore point would be lost. You should make an export of this content before using our restore feature, then you can import it back to your site after the restore. How long does it take to restore?

See our article about Adding Credentials in the Jetpack Plugin. The steps below explain exactly how to get SSH, SFTP, or FTP credentials and enter them into the Jetpack VaultPress Backup Plugin. Jetpack VaultPress Backup will start to back up your site as soon as you install the plugin, purchase a backup plan, and connect the site to Jetpack. If your backups don’t start immediately, you can add SSH, SFTP, or FTP credentials to bypass other issues and create a backup right away. Credentials are also needed to restore your site from a previous backup. File Access Permissions When creating credentials to use with Jetpack VaultPress Backup, you need to set the correct access permissions. For Jetpack VaultPress Backup, the credentials need full read and write access to the WordPress directory. This allows VaultPress Backup to back up your files (read access), upload the helper script, and restore files (write access). Note: The required settings could vary depending on your host, so please contact them to ensure you’re using the correct configuration. ℹ️ What is Helper Script?The Helper Script is used to fetch data from your site efficiently. It can walk directory trees, hash files, fetch WordPress config information, and fetch database tables. They expire automatically 6 hours after being uploaded to the server. They’re unique to the server that uploaded them, and only that server can access them due to randomly generated keys only the uploading server knows about.

Password: If using SSH credentials, this password is optional. Host/IP Address: If my site uses Cloudflare, I require the IP address for the server my site is located on, otherwise the URL that points to my site on the server is fine.

This article covers how to allowlist IPs for Jetpack, Jetpack VaultPress Backup, and the older VaultPress, and shows our hosting requirements. An allowlist lists IP addresses or domains that are provided privileged access or treatment. It is the opposite of a blocklist intended to block or restrict access. Some hosting could use other words to identify the allowed IPs list on their systems. If you have questions, the recommendation is to contact your host support for more information. Allow all Communications Between Jetpack and WordPress. com Some hosts and plugins believe that blocking access to xmlrpc. php will stop various hacking attempts. However, XML-RPC support has been built into WordPress core since version 3.5 and is a stable tool. Jetpack, like other plugins, services, and mobile apps, relies on the XML-RPC file to communicate with WordPress. com. If this is blocked, your Jetpack connection will stop working properly. You should be able to protect a site’s XML-RPC file without having to allow specific IP ranges. The most popular hosts use tools like fail2ban or ModSecurity, for example.

See our article about the Jetpack Protect Plugin. Jetpack Firewall examines incoming traffic to a WordPress site and decides to allow or block it based on various rules. This adds an important layer of protection to your site, particularly when attackers actively exploit unpatched vulnerabilities. On Jetpack Firewall, you can configure IP addresses that will never be blocked (even if a rule would normally) or always be blocked (regardless of the rules). To allow or block incoming traffic based on various rules, you will need a plan that includes Jetpack Scan, such as Jetpack Security, Jetpack Complete, or Jetpack Scan, and a connection to your WordPress. com account. If you previously had a Jetpack plan that includes Jetpack Scan and/or your site becomes disconnected from your WordPress. com account, you will continue to have access to the Jetpack Firewall settings in your Jetpack dashboard. This is to ensure that your IP allow/block lists and previous firewall rules remain functional. Turning on the Firewall This feature is deactivated by default when you connect Jetpack to your WordPress. com account. It can be activated at any time on your Jetpack Settings page. To enable Jetpack WAF: Select Jetpack → Settings → Security → Firewall in your site’s WP Admin Enable Protect your site with Jetpack’s Web Application Firewall How to set up the Firewall options? To add IP addresses to a block/allow list: Select Jetpack → Settings → Security → Firewall in your site’s WP Admin Enable Allow / Block list – Block or allow a specific request IP You can add IP addresses to your block / allow list by entering complete IP addresses, separated by commas. Adding IP ranges or IP addresses in CIDR notation is not supported at the moment. Once you’ve entered IP addresses to your block / allow list, click on Save Settings to save your block / allow list. These are the Jetpack Firewall options: Allow / Block list – Block or allow a specific request IP: This option allows you to add an IP blocklist and IP allowlist to your site. Share data with Jetpack: This option allows Jetpack to collect data to improve Firewall protection and rules. You can check Jetpack Privacy before you set this option. Enhance Protection: You don’t need to activate Enhance Protection; however, if you want the Firewall feature to be able to inspect all requests and run them before WordPress initializes, this is how: In case you want to activate the Enhance protection, you need to contact your hosting support to make the changes on the server level. Upgrade notification If you don’t have a Scan subscription yet, a notification will show on your Firewall options. After upgrading, the notification disappears. Troubleshooting What happens if I don’t renew my subscription? Any rules delivered to the site will remain functional after the subscription lapses or is removed. Can I use the IP allow and block lists behind a reverse proxy (like Cloudflare)?

There are configuration options for that overlay available in the Customizer. You can use the Customize Jetpack Search page or the WordPress theme customizer to configure the colors and styles of the Instant Search results overlay to better match your theme. You can also adjust how your search results are sorted, which post types to exclude from search results and several additional display settings. Take a look at the following sections to learn how to customize Instant Search in different ways. Using the Customize Jetpack Search Page To navigate to the Customize Jetpack Search page: With Jetpack and/or the Jetpack Search plugin installed and active, go to WP Admin → Jetpack → Search. Click Customize search results. See Starting with Jetpack Search plugin for more information. You can also get to the Customize Jetpack Search page by going to WP Admin → Jetpack → Settings, selecting the Performance tab and clicking Customize your Search experience. For more information, please see Search via the Jetpack plugin. To the right of the Customize Jetpack Search page, you will see a sidebar that shows you all the available customization options. Styling: Light and Dark Mode This allows you to set the display mode for the search results overlay to light or dark mode. In light mode, dark or black text is shown on a white or light background, while in dark mode, white or light-colored text is displayed on a dark or black background. Styling: Result Format This allows you to choose the format of the search results: Minimal: This shows just the title, slug, and excerpt or product description (for WooCommerce stores). Expanded: This shows images along with the search results. Product: This shows search results in a grid format rather than linearly and is best for WooCommerce stores. Styling: Highlight for Search Terms This allows you to choose the highlight color for search terms as they appear in search results (in the titles and excerpts or descriptions). There are a good number of colors to select from. Setting: Default Sort This setting allows you to select the default sort order for the search results: Relevance: This is the recommended and default choice. When selected, Jetpack will show results in the order of most relevant to the search term to least relevant. Newest first: When selected, Jetpack will sort the results by date and show the newest records first. Oldest first: When selected, Jetpack will sort the results by date and show the oldest records first. Setting: Overlay Trigger This setting allows you to select your preferred trigger for the search results overlay: Open when user submits the form: This is the recommended and default choice. When selected, the overlay shows up when the user submits the search form by either clicking Search or tapping the Enter or return key on their keyboard; in other words, when the user has finished entering their search term or query. Open when user starts typing: When selected, the overlay shows up as soon as the user starts typing their search term or query, and the results get updated as the user continues to type. Setting: Excluded Post Types This setting allows you to exclude records that belong to one or more post types from the search results. This might be useful when you have private or restricted post types with records you don’t want users to find. Additional Settings The additional settings include: Show sort selector: This is enabled by default. You can toggle this off to hide the sort selector from the search results overlay if you don’t want users to select how they want the results shown to be ordered. Enable infinite scroll: This is also enabled by default. When enabled, as the user scrolls down to the end of the visible list of search results, more results are loaded and displayed. You can toggle this off to disable that behavior. Configure Instant Search from the Customizer To navigate to the Customizing Jetpack Search section of the customizer: With Jetpack and/or the Jetpack Search plugin installed and active, go to WP Admin → Appearance → Customize. Click Jetpack Search. Once there, you will see the same customization options described above: You can also get to the Customizing Jetpack Search section of the customizer from the Customize Jetpack Search page described above. Select the Jetpack Search tab and click Configure in the Customizer. You can set the following from the Customizer: Theme: This determines whether your search overlay is in light or dark mode. Result Format: This determines how the search results look. Default Sort: This determines the initial sort for your search results. Search Input Overlay Trigger: This determines when your overlay should appear. Excluded Post Types: This lets you choose post types to exclude from search results. You must leave at least one post type unchecked. Highlight Search Terms: This lets you choose a color to highlight matching search terms. Configuring Filters When you enable Jetpack Search, a widget area called Jetpack Search Sidebar will automatically be added to your site. This widget area controls what appears in the right sidebar on the search results overlay. The sidebar comes preloaded with filters that you can remove and configure as you like. You can configure the filters that will be available to your users on both desktop and mobile searches. You can adjust these filters by going to Customizer → Widgets → Jetpack Search Sidebar. If you add filters in a different widget area outside of the Jetpack Search Sidebar, any filters you configure will open the search overlay automatically, no matter where the widget lives. The available filters are: Post types Custom Taxonomies (only a subset are supported) Categories Tags Formats Product categories Product tags Product shipping classes Date Year Month If you remove all the widgets from the Jetpack Search Sidebar widget area, the right sidebar will disappear from the search results overlay and your results will span the full width of the overlay. Adding a Search Box The Jetpack Search overlay should get triggered by almost any search box that is on your site’s pages. If your theme has a sidebar then the easiest way to add a search box is to add the Jetpack Search widget (if available) or block into the sidebar area from Customizer > Widgets > Sidebar. This will let you also configure and display filters so that visitors can quickly discover and browse through content on your site. If your theme does not have a sidebar or a built-in search box then you can add it by creating a child theme and then adding code to your header that calls get_search_form(). Some themes will have a built-in search box that is not compatible with Jetpack Search. If this is the case for you, there are a few things you can try. Adding a Search Button Sometimes all you need is a search button on your site to open the overlay. The search button on the top of this page uses this HTML: <a class=\"header__search-btn jetpack-search-filter__link\" href=\"#\"> <svg class=\"gridicon gridicons-search\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" xmlns=\"http://www. w3. org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><g><path d=\"M21 19l-5.154-5.154C16.574 12.742 17 11.42 17 10c0-3.866-3.134-7-7-7s-7 3.134-7 7 3.134 7 7 7c1.42 0 2.742-.426 3.846-1.154L19 21l2-2zM5 10c0-2.757 2.243-5 5-5s5 2.243 5 5-2.243 5-5 5-5-2.243-5-5z\"></path></g></svg> </a> Opening the Search Overlay From a Link Any link on the page can trigger opening the search overlay as well as applying whatever filters you desire. The link needs a few special attributes to work: Set the class for the a HTML tag to jetpack-search-filter__link and the href attribute to # To filter by a taxonomy, the link attributes are data-filter-type, data-taxonomy, and data-val. For example, data-filter-type=\"taxonomy\" data-taxonomy=\"category\" data-val=\"performance\" To filter by month, the link attributes are: data-filter-type=\"month_post_date\" data-val=\"2020-01-01\" To filter by year, the link attributes are: data-filter-type=\"year_post_date\" data-val=\"2020-01-01\" To filter by post type, the link attributes are: data-filter-type=\"post_type\" data-val=\"jetpack_support\" Here is an example to filter by the product post type: <a href=\"#\" class=\"jetpack-search-filter__link\" data-filter-type=\"post_types\" data-val=\"product\" >Search Products</a> Note: Custom filter links will only work if that taxonomy was configured as a filter in a Jetpack Search widget or the Jetpack Search Sidebar.

To learn more about how to use Jetpack Social, please see our support documentation on Jetpack Social. Why are you introducing free and paid tiers? Jetpack Social’s main auto-sharing feature (Publicize) was previously in maintenance mode. It’s worked well for many years, but we’ve decided it’s time to bring this feature to life again and expand its capabilities. We will be offering these plans: Free plan: Auto-share your posts to social media up to 30 times within a 30-day rolling period. Share when you publish, or schedule shares for the future. Preview how your posts will look on social networks. Save images to your Media Library. Allow other users on your site to share to your social connections. Re-share previously published posts. Basic plan: For sites that need more than 30 shares every 30 days, the Basic plan allows for up to 1,000* shares every 30 days. Advanced Plan: In addition to unlimited shares, the Advanced plan boasts the most feature-packed plan that Social has to offer: Engagement optimization. Video sharing (coming soon). Image generator (coming soon). Multi-image generator (coming soon). * For this introductory period, there is no sharing limit on the Basic plan so you can explore the new features and share as much as you want! What is a share? A share is one social media post made by sharing a blog post on a social media platform. How are shares counted? Each social media platform a blog post is shared to via Jetpack Social counts as one share. For example, if a single blog post is shared to Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, that counts as three shares. How do I know how many shares I’ve used in the last 30 days? If you have the standalone Jetpack Social plugin active, go to Jetpack → Social in your WP Admin. If you are on the free plan, you will see how many shares you have left for the rolling 30-day period: Share counter for Jetpack Social Free plan showing the remaining number of shares for the current period. If you have a paid Jetpack Social plan, you will see the number of social posts made under Total shares this month and the number of blog posts that were shared under Posted this month on the main Jetpack Social page in WP Admin. Again, this is only when you are using the standalone Jetpack Social plugin. A meter that shows the number of social shares and blog posts shared in a month.

The auto-share feature will stop working until you fall beneath 30 shares in the rolling 30-day period.

Using the Image Performance Guide On your WP Admin dashboard, navigate to Jetpack → Boost, scroll down the page and toggle the Image Guide feature. Check the images on your site. While logged in, visit your site, and you will see a bubble with a number on every image. When hovering over the bubble, a card with the details about the image will be displayed as follows: The image name. If you click on it, the image will be opened in a new tab. Image File Dimensions. This shows the actual size of the image. Expected Dimensions. This is the suggested ideal size of the image in order for it to be loaded on the page as quickly as possible. Size on screen. This shows the size of the image displayed on the screen when visiting the page. Image Size. This shows the actual file size for the image. Potential savings: This shows how much the file size could be reduced by resizing the image to match the Expected Dimensions exactly. Overview Testing with different devices and settings The Image Performance Guide shows you information about your images as they appear on the current device. We recommend testing your site from a few different device types to ensure that they are served efficiently no matter how users visit your site. For example, different devices have a different pixel density. Pixel density is a measure of how many pixels appear within a given area of the screen. It can affect the number of pixels used on the screen to render an image at a particular size. As the Image Performance Guide shows you how well your images suit the current device, it is worth testing it from multiple devices – such as computers and phones to get a more complete picture of how well optimized your images are on different screens. Zooming your web page in or out can also affect your browser’s pixel density, affecting the results from the Image Performance Guide. We recommend using the feature at the standard zoom level for your browser. Small Indicators Our goal is to show relevant information without being intrusive. For smaller images, the overlay bubble is going to appear as a small dot instead. Pausing the Image Guide Once the image guide is turned on, you can set the feature as needed to Active or Paused from the WordPress Admin bar by clicking Image Guide. FAQ How can Image Guide Help? What can I learn from the Image Performance Guide feature to help improve my site’s performance? The Image Performance Guide will calculate the recommended dimensions for images on your site. By resizing your images to these dimensions, you can reduce the file size and reduce the amount of time that the page takes to load. Can Jetpack Boost optimize my images for me? No. While Jetpack Boost analyzes your existing images to calculate their ideal size, Jetpack Boost will not actually resize the images for you. Using the information that Jetpack Boost provides, you’ll need to resize the images yourself, then re-upload them to your media library and replace the existing images on the page. What does optimizing my site’s images do? By optimizing the size of your site images, you can improve the performance of your site, which can help site pages load more efficiently. What can I do to optimize my images? Before uploading them to the Media Library Before uploading your images to the media library, we recommend taking the following actions: Resize: Make sure that the image size you’re uploading is sufficient for the way you’ll be using it. For example, if you’re going to be using an image at a max size of 800px by 800px, upload the image at that size. File Type: This really depends on the purpose of the image: JPG: If you want an image that loads quickly, doesn’t have a transparent background, and the image doesn’t need to have a great deal of detail, using a JPG is recommended. This is good for things like photos that will be used in a gallery, or other applications where a super high quality image isn’t needed. PNG: If you want an image that has a transparent background, and needs to be super high quality, using a PNG is recommended. This is good for things like logos, or other images that a user may look at in high detail, such as product images. Using Site Accelerator The main Jetpack plugin includes Site Accelerator; a free service which optimizes your images and serves them from a global network of servers, allowing users to load them from a location closer to them. Site Accelerator automatically resizes your images to fit in many situations. We recommend using Site Accelerator to improve the performance of your images, particularly in cases where the Image Guide indicates they are over-sized. Using the Media Library You can resize images directly in your Media Library to give them a more appropriate size. Editing images and scaling them to an appropriate size is a non-destructive operation – that is, it creates a new version of your image at the size you specify, leaving your original image unchanged. Can I use the Image Guide feature with page builders? Some page builders use iframes to render content, which results in the Image Guide displaying details in the admin area. To provide a lean experience, we disabled Image Guide when page builders are used. Privacy Information This feature is deactivated by default. However, when activated, you can deactivate the feature by visiting the Jetpack Boost dashboard, and clicking the toggle for the Image Guide.

No. ","length":946,"tokens":191},{"title":"Jetpack Boost: Image Performance Guide","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-boost/image-performance-guide/","content":"While Jetpack Boost analyzes your existing images to calculate their ideal size, Jetpack Boost will not actually resize the images for you. Using the information that Jetpack Boost provides, you’ll need to resize the images yourself, then re-upload them to your media library and replace the existing images on the page. What does optimizing my site’s images do? By optimizing the size of your site images, you can improve the performance of your site, which can help site pages load more efficiently. What can I do to optimize my images? Before uploading them to the Media Library Before uploading your images to the media library, we recommend taking the following actions: Resize: Make sure that the image size you’re uploading is sufficient for the way you’ll be using it. For example, if you’re going to be using an image at a max size of 800px by 800px, upload the image at that size.

This is good for things like photos that will be used in a gallery, or other applications where a super high quality image isn’t needed. PNG: If you want an image that has a transparent background, and needs to be super high quality, using a PNG is recommended. This is good for things like logos, or other images that a user may look at in high detail, such as product images. Using Site Accelerator The main Jetpack plugin includes Site Accelerator; a free service which optimizes your images and serves them from a global network of servers, allowing users to load them from a location closer to them. Site Accelerator automatically resizes your images to fit in many situations.

Using the Media Library You can resize images directly in your Media Library to give them a more appropriate size. Editing images and scaling them to an appropriate size is a non-destructive operation – that is, it creates a new version of your image at the size you specify, leaving your original image unchanged. Can I use the Image Guide feature with page builders? Some page builders use iframes to render content, which results in the Image Guide displaying details in the admin area.

Requirements The Jetpack plugin should be installed and connected on your site. New to Jetpack? Check out the guide here to get started. Currently, Blaze is only available to users who have their WordPress. com interface set to the English language. How to Blaze your content Follow these steps to set up a Blaze campaign: On your WordPress. com dashboard, navigate to the Posts or Pages screen, then scroll to the post or page you’d like to Blaze. Click the three dots icon on the right, then click Promote with Blaze. Once you select the page or post you want to promote, you will be taken to the campaign wizard where you will need to configure the Appearance, Audience & Budget, and Payment for your campaign.

Appearance This section asks for three pieces of information to determine how your Blaze campaign will look when promoted across the network. Title: This appears above your image and as bolded text. You can write a maximum of 23 characters here — use them wisely to capture the viewer’s attention. Snippet: A short text description of your post that appears underneath your image. You can write a maximum of 70 characters here. We recommend using this text to support your headline and give viewers more context about what they will see when they click the ad and arrive at your content. Image: Upload an image to represent your post. You can use the crop tool to adjust your image’s appearance in the ad. Audience & Budget As you adjust your settings on this screen, your ad preview will reflect your choices and provide you with an estimated reach for your campaign, which is the number of times your ad will be shown. Choose who will see your ad by selecting from the following dropdowns: Devices: Choose if you would like your post to be seen by viewers on desktop computers or mobile devices.

You can cancel your campaigns at any time. You will only be charged for the portion of your campaign that had already been served up until that point. It is not possible to refund any charges for ads served, so make sure to set your budget to an amount you are willing to pay. Ad Approval We review all Blaze campaigns for compliance with our Advertising Policy before they are seen by others. We try to moderate posts as quickly as possible, depending on how much content we need to review. Currently, we average around 30 minutes, but there’s no guaranteed time. If your post has been approved, you will receive an email saying that your post was approved and will be put online. Your post will be rejected if it does not conform to our Advertising Policy.

However, in some cases, you may want to make additional improvements. This guide offers some suggestions on how to improve your site’s speed and performance. Note: Optimizing your site’s speed and performance isn’t something we can assist with per our Scope of Support. The suggestions here are provided as-is. Measuring your Site Speed In Jetpack Boost, we provide a numeric score and letter grade that indicates your site speed score as measured by Google. An example screenshot showing this: In some cases, you may find that you want to continue to optimize the speed of your site or that Jetpack Boost doesn’t make the improvement you are looking for. What follows are some additional suggestions. While the numbers in Jetpack Boost give you some guidance, you can get more information using Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool. This is the same tool used by Jetpack Boost to measure your site, but by running it directly on your site, you get more insight into why your site has been given a specific score. Additionally, Google provides recommendations for how to address the issues it encounters. Screenshot showing Google PageSpeed Insights Common Improvements The following are some common steps that you can take to improve your site’s speed. Depending on the site’s goal, not all recommendations suit all situations. As you work through the recommendations, you can test periodically to see if the site speed improves. Additionally, as you update your site and add plugins and content, you may find that your site speed changes. Over time, strategies that worked in the past may not have the same effect they once did. We recommend testing your site’s speed regularly and making adjustments as needed. Optimize CSS Loading Your website’s appearance is controlled by CSS, which tells the web browser how to display your site’s content. Because of the amount of content on modern websites, CSS files tend to be quite large. Additionally, plugins may add their own CSS. This means that a large amount of information has to be parsed before your content is displayed. This can be sped up by optimizing your CSS loading so that the code needed to display the immediately visible content is given to the browser first. This helps speed up the initial page load. This is referred to as Critical CSS. While this is difficult to do manually, Jetpack Boost does this for you. Jetpack Boost also offers a paid upgrade that generates Critical CSS automatically each time your site changes. Enable Jetpack Site Accelerator Jetpack Site Accelerator is a content delivery network (CDN) that can help speed up your site by serving optimized images and cached static assets (CSS and JavaScript) from high-speed and dedicated data centers. It will automatically resize images and serve them in the best format for your site, which can reduce your site’s load time. Additionally, it will load certain core WordPress files from these data centers. Lazy Load Images Lazy Loading makes pages load much faster by only loading visible images while waiting to load off-screen images as you scroll down. This feature can improve site performance and is especially great for users in low-bandwidth or expensive-bandwidth environments, such as users on mobile devices. You can enable Lazy Loading in Jetpack or Jetpack Boost. Optimize Images Images can be a major source of slow site speeds. Large and unoptimized images are a frequent cause of this. In addition to techniques mentioned elsewhere in this guide (using a CDN), you might consider optimizing images before adding them to your site. For starters, it helps to choose the proper image format for your situation. For example, a PNG is good if you need transparency, but if you are uploading a photo, it isn’t a good choice. Google has an excellent guide for choosing the right image format. You should also size images appropriately for your content area. For example, if your theme serves images at a maximum width of 1,000 pixels wide, you can resize your images to be 1,000 pixels wide before uploading them. Additionally, you can optimize your images using your image editing program or a tool like TinyPNG or JPEGmini. There are also many third-party plugins for image optimization. Jetpack Boost includes an Image Performance Guide that can help identify images that may need additional optimization. Add a Caching Plugin Adding a caching plugin to your WordPress site can help increase your site speed. Typically, when a page is accessed on a WordPress site, the requested page is compiled on the server when someone visits it. This requires multiple calls to your site’s database. This is generally fine, but if many requests are being made simultaneously, it may slow down your site. A caching plugin helps, as it will save a page once requested. The next time that page is requested, the plugin WordPress will use the previously compiled page rather than making a new request. This reduces the load on your server by eliminating database requests. We recommend the WP Super Cache plugin, which is made by our parent company, Automattic, and works with Jetpack. You can read more about configuring it on the WP Super Cache wiki. Note: If your site is hosted on WordPress. com, caching is already built-in, and you don’t need a separate plugin. Reduce Unnecessary JavaScript When you test your site with Google’s PageSpeed Insights, you may see mention of reducing JavaScript. Some common suggestions are “Reduce JavaScript execution time” and “Reduce unused JavaScript”. To help with this, you can try turning on the “Defer Non-Essential JavaScript” setting in Jetpack Boost. If you are still having this issue, you may want to remove JavaScript that you aren’t using. For example, if your site has Google Analytics and you are never using the Analytics data, it may not make sense to collect it, and removing the script from your page may increase your site speed. Unused third-party scripts can also increase your site’s load time. It is worth checking to see if there are unused scripts that can be removed. If you use Google Tag Manager, you should ensure you need all the scripts added to your site. Reduce Unused Plugins The more plugins you have installed on your site, the more resources your server needs to respond to requests. You can potentially improve your site speed score by removing plugins that you are no longer using. Depending on the plugins installed, this will remove unused JavaScript and CSS assets that may be loading on your site. Consider a Theme Change Your site’s theme may be contributing to slow load times. The quality of WordPress themes varies widely, and some are more performant than others. It can be worth testing your page speed with different themes. You might find that your theme is the bottleneck, so changing the theme would be an excellent next step. Add a Content Delivery Network (CDN) A Content Delivery Network (CDN) can help increase your site’s speed by caching requests and serving pages from data centers close to your visitors. The shorter distance data has to travel, the faster the page load time. A popular solution with a generous free plan is Cloudflare. You can read about how to configure it with Jetpack here. Cloudflare also helps to block malicious requests, which can further reduce server load. If your site hosts video content, you might want to consider loading this content from a cloud-based server. Jetpack VideoPress can automatically load optimized videos from data centers close to your site’s visitors, enhancing your site’s speed. Offload Resource Intensive Tasks to Cloud Servers At the core of any WordPress installation is a database. Each time a page loads, WordPress queries the database and then displays the page. All of your site’s content is in this database, and depending on the plugins and functionality used on your site, large numbers of queries can slow down your site. Some tasks in WordPress, such as search and plugins that generate related content, are particularly intensive. Jetpack’s Search and Related Posts allow you to offload this work to WordPress. com’s servers. Reduce Server Response Time The actual performance of your web server can also affect site speed. If this is the case, you may see an indicator in Google PageSpeed identifying an issue with the Time to First Byte (TTFB) on your web server. If Google PageSpeed indicates that your server is slow, you will want to reach out to your hosting provider. They may be able to offer additional advice or upgrade your account. If they cannot assist, you may wish to move to a different and more performant host, such as WordPress. com. Business plans and above allow you to install plugins.","length":8835,"tokens":1820,"chunks":[{"title":"Improving your Site Speed Score","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-boost/improving-your-site-speed-score/","content":"Improving your Site Speed Score Jetpack offers several tools to improve your site’s speed, including Site Accelerator and Jetpack Boost.

We bill for all licenses that have been issued from your Jetpack Pro Partner account, even if they haven’t been assigned to a site yet. When you issue a license, a totally new license is generated by our systems and is considered active from the moment it was issued, even if it has not been assigned to a site yet. Why are we billed for days used instead of months? We bill for days rather than months to provide as much flexibility to our Agency Partners as possible. Because we only bill for the days a license was active over the course of a month, you’re able to issue, revoke, and even transfer licenses whenever you need to. All while only being billed for the time a license is active. Why does my invoice list days rather than months? Days are shown on your monthly invoice because we use days as the unit of measurement when calculating your monthly bill. Our payment partner, Stripe, generates your monthly invoice according to how many active licenses have been issued from your account. How do I add/change/remove a payment method? You can view the payment methods stored in the Jetpack Pro Dashboard here: https://cloud. jetpack. com/partner-portal/payment-methods Add a new payment method by clicking the “New credit card” button. Enter your new card’s payment details and click “Save payment method” to add it to your account. To delete a saved payment method, click the ⋮ button. Click the “Delete” button to delete the payment method from your account. To set a card as your “primary” payment method, make sure to check the Set as primary payment method option when adding it to the Jetpack Pro Dashboard. What happens when I do not have a payment method on file? If you do not have a payment method on file, your ability to issue new licenses from the Jetpack Pro Dashboard will be paused until you add a new payment method to your account. If you remove all saved payment methods before being charged for the month, you will need to pay any past due invoice before you can assign new licenses. Who do I contact if I require additional assistance? Please contact Jetpack Support directly, or reach out to the Jetpack Agency & Pro Manager.

Learn more about XML-RPC and how it powers Jetpack. What is XML-RPC? XML-RPC is a protocol that allows communication between your website and external servers. Jetpack uses this protocol to connect your site to WordPress. com. WordPress’s core software has had XML-RPC support since WordPress version 3.4 and is considered a stable tool. You can learn more about WordPress’s XML-RPC API and how it can be leveraged in the WordPress. org developer resources. How does XML-RPC work? With Jetpack, your site becomes an XML-RPC server, so that WordPress. com can communicate with while it establishes a connection to WordPress. com. Similar to other API implementations, it requires a preset list of procedures that can be called remotely, as well as a specific list of data it can provide. Is XML-RPC deprecated? Although XML-RPC has lost popularity, it’s still widely used. While newer APIs are often built upon other standards like REST or GraphQL, XML-RPC is integrated into a huge number of existing systems, so it’s not going anywhere anytime soon. Is XML-RPC removed from PHP? The PHP (PECL) XML-RPC extension provides functionality to simplify development of XML-RPC APIs. Beginning with PHP 8.0, the extension is no longer bundled into PHP and needs to be installed separately. Jetpack does not use this extension. Jetpack sites are not affected by this change. Jetpack includes its own implementation of XML-RPC that does not rely on this PHP extension. What security concerns are there with using XML-RPC? Just like most technologies, it’s neither secure nor vulnerable by itself. It all depends on the particular implementation, and Jetpack provides the most secure way to use it. Typical integrations with an XML-RPC API send a username and password in plain text to facilitate communication between your website and the service leveraging it. This does make the use of this API less secure. However, Jetpack’s XML-RPC integration is different. How is Jetpack’s XML-RPC integration different? Jetpack doesn’t send a username and password through any API to connect your site to WordPress. com. Our connection method is different in that we use a token-based system, similar to OAuth. This means that instead of sending a username and password, Jetpack generates a special string called an API signature, which gets attached to all API requests. Before sending the request, the API signature gets encoded using a secret token. Think of the secret token like a cipher used to turn a message into a secret code. First, the message sender uses that cipher to turn the message into a secret code. Then the message receiver, who also has access to the cipher, can use it to translate the secret code back into the original message. Jetpack’s usage of XML-RPC works very similarly. The only place that the secret token (a. k. a. the cipher) exists is on your Jetpack site and on the WordPress. com server that your site communicates with. This means that even if the API request were to be intercepted along the way, there wouldn’t be a way to decode the API signature because decoding that API signature requires access to the secret token. This approach is considered universally safe and reliable, and is in use by other API standards, including REST. What benefits are there to using XML-RPC over the REST API? For Jetpack, it’s all about stability. Continuing to use XML-RPC means that users who are on older versions of Jetpack can still leverage the features of Jetpack. While we strongly recommend keeping your Jetpack plugin up to date, we understand that isn’t always possible. We don’t want to abandon our users on older versions of the plugin, so we intend to stick with XML-RPC for as long as we can. If at some point in the future we have to make the transition to the REST API, we will communicate this transition to our users prior to the switch.","length":3978,"tokens":887,"chunks":[{"title":"Jetpack and XML-RPC","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-and-xml-rpc/","content":"Jetpack and XML-RPC XML-RPC is a communication protocol that Jetpack uses to connect your site to WordPress. com.

You can follow these troubleshooting steps to fix issues with Jetpack Scan. Check the Site’s Jetpack Connection A working Jetpack connection is required to get Jetpack Scan working properly. Before attempting any other troubleshooting steps, make sure your site’s Jetpack connection is working. The Jetpack connection is used to facilitate scans of your site. There are times when the connection can become unstable or broken. This may be due to a misconfiguration of your site or hosting. The first thing to do is check the connection status using the Jetpack Debug page. If it reports any issues with the connection, please see the Fixing Jetpack Connection Issues guide. Check your site’s connection on the Jetpack Debug page. Troubleshoot the connection using the Fixing Jetpack Connection Issues guide. Add Server Credentials If your site’s Jetpack connection is working, Jetpack Scan should begin working again. In some situations, your site may still run into errors. If the site’s Jetpack connection is working and Jetpack Scan is still having issues scanning the site, the next step is to add server credentials. Adding server credentials is required to auto-fix any threats detected by Jetpack Scan, so by adding server credentials you are better prepared if you do need to fix a threat. Adding server credentials is done differently depending on which Jetpack plugin you’re using. See these guides for more information: Adding Credentials in the Jetpack Plugin Adding Credentials to the Jetpack VaultPress Backup Plugin Check File Permissions Ensure your SFTP/SSH/FTP credentials have full read and write file permissions to your WordPress installation directory. Once your credentials have full read and write file permissions to your WordPress installation directory, you can wait for a new scan to run the next day, or trigger a new scan by clicking the Scan Now button on your Scan page. Review Security and Firewall Settings Even with a working Jetpack connection and server credentials, we can still see failed scans. Web Application Firewalls (WAF) such as Cloudflare or Sucuri can block SSH/SFTP/FTP connections, or a security plugin installed on the site may be blocking certain network requests. If you are comfortable, please review and adjust any WAF or security plugin settings to allow all communications between your site and Jetpack. If not, we recommend temporarily disabling these services/features while troubleshooting Jetpack Scan. Generally, this can be achieved by disabling the plugin, but you might also have to disable a feature in the service provider’s dashboard (i. e.: pausing Cloudflare from their dashboard). Speak to Your Host Even when everything has been set up correctly it’s still possible to see errors. This is usually due to security settings outside your control. Examples of this would be hosts who run ModSecurity at a level above what the hosting control panel exposes. Often this type of security is automated and kicks in temporarily when the server sees repeated requests from a certain IP or too many requests in a given window of time. The best way to get around this is to have your host allowlist Jetpack. You can direct them to our Hosting Reference Documentation page for the necessary details. See the section titled, “Allowlist IPs”. If you are not sure about who your site is hosted with you can check using WhoIsHostingThis. com. Some security and firewall plugins may also block requests from Jetpack; adding the same IP ranges to these plugins may be required. You could also try temporarily disabling other plugins to determine which may be blocking requests. No Longer Need Jetpack Scan?

You can follow these troubleshooting steps to fix issues with Jetpack Scan. Check the Site’s Jetpack Connection A working Jetpack connection is required to get Jetpack Scan working properly. Before attempting any other troubleshooting steps, make sure your site’s Jetpack connection is working. The Jetpack connection is used to facilitate scans of your site. There are times when the connection can become unstable or broken. This may be due to a misconfiguration of your site or hosting. The first thing to do is check the connection status using the Jetpack Debug page. If it reports any issues with the connection, please see the Fixing Jetpack Connection Issues guide.

Our different backup plans have different retention timeframes: Jetpack VaultPress Backup 10 GB: You can choose between 7 days, 30 days, 120 days, or 1 year. If your site’s storage limit is reached for the backup retention period you’ve selected, you will need to purchase a storage add-on or reduce the retention period. Jetpack Personal and Jetpack Premium: 30 days Jetpack Professional: Unlimited Jetpack Backup Daily and Jetpack Security Daily: 30 days Jetpack Backup Realtime, Jetpack Security Realtime, and Jetpack Complete: 1 year How is storage usage calculated? Storage is roughly calculated as the size of your most recent daily backup times how many daily backups we have saved. So if your last backup was 1GB and we keep 30 days’ worth of backups, you will be using 30GB of storage. In reality, it’s a bit more complicated (files are replicated in multiple data servers for redundancy, we keep real-time data and metadata, etc.), so we simplify it in a way that is easier to digest and keep track of. Can I choose how many days of backups should be stored? You can choose whether you’d like Jetpack to save your backups from the past 7 days, 30 days, 120 days, or 1 year. To access this feature, please follow these steps: Go to https://cloud. jetpack. com. In the left sidebar, click Settings. Select how many days of backups you’d like us to store. You’ll see an estimate of how much storage is required for each option, and whether you’ll need to upgrade to add more storage to accommodate your choice. Please note that reducing your retention time means you will immediately no longer have access to the older backups that fall outside of your chosen retention period. How do I get more storage? We will reach out to you if you are approaching your storage limit, with a recommendation of a storage add-on. You can buy extra storage in the amount of 10GB, 100GB, or 1TB, so you can tailor your plan to fit your individual needs. These add-ons are currently only available for monthly billing, but we hope to add a yearly billing option soon. What will happen if I reach my backup storage limit? When the storage limit has been reached, we’ll start removing your oldest backups to clear up storage space. We will continue removing backups down to the most recent 7 days’ worth of backups. If those backups are still over the storage limit, we will stop generating new backups. You will continue to have access to the 7 days prior to when you hit the limit, but new backups will not be generated until you upgrade your storage. To ensure uninterrupted, real-time backups of your site, if you’ve reached the storage limit, please either reduce your backup retention period, increase your storage, or reduce your storage size. What can I do to reduce my storage size? There are a few things that you can do to reduce your storage size: Delete Old Images: If you have old, unused images in your media library, deleting these will help reduce storage size. Optimize Image Size: There are tools online that you can use to optimize your images that will reduce image size, as well as plugins that do this as you upload them to your media library. Optimize Video Size: We recommend uploading videos meeting these specifications. Delete Old Drafts: If you have old draft posts and pages that you don’t see being published, move them to trash, and then delete them permanently from trash. Plugins: Reduce the number of plugins you’re using. Check out the full list of features for the Jetpack plugin. You may be using plugins that do something that Jetpack has already built-in. Themes: Reduce the number of themes you have installed on your site. We recommend that you keep your site’s currently used theme plus at least one WordPress default theme, such as Twenty Twenty for troubleshooting purposes.

We’re not able to provide direct assistance with managing your site’s files or reducing the overall size of your site.

On the “Traffic” view, you can find 7-day highlights, engagement (views and visitors) graphs, top posts and pages, website referrer data, visitor locations, top search terms, and so on. You can also filter your engagement data to focus on daily, weekly, monthly, or annual traffic. To access this view: Go to your site’s WP Admin. Then, go to Jetpack → Stats. Click the Traffic tab. Note: The data in this view is updated every 30 minutes. 7-day highlights This is a snapshot of recent traffic to your site. 7-day Highlights provide a quick look at the number of your visitors, views, likes, and comments over the last 7 days, excluding the current day. The trends shown are also compared to the previous 7-day period. View and visitors These bar graphs show views and visitor data. A view refers to when a visitor loads or reloads a page. A visitor refers to when we see a user or browser for the first time in a selected time frame. Note: A visitor is an individual looking at your site. A visitor can view your site’s different pages or the same page multiple times. Therefore, you can expect views to be higher than visitors. Weekly and monthly unique visitors Weekly and monthly unique visitors may be less than daily or total visitors if the same visitor appears multiple times. Views are reported faster than visitors, which may cause a lag in visitor counts. Yearly totals are the sum of monthly totals. Viewing a selected time period The graph shows different time periods such as day, week, month, or year. The selected time period is highlighted in a different color, and the stats for that period will appear below the graph. If you click on another bar in the graph, the time period will change, and the information below the graph will show the stats for the new time period. When you hover your mouse over a bar on the graph, highlights for that time period will pop up, as shown above. Likes and comments The charts also include tabs for viewing stats for the number of likes and comments on your site. Click the Likes or Comments tabs to display a bar chart for those stats. Posts & pages This part of Traffic shows which posts and pages got the most views during the time period you chose at the top of the page. When someone visits your post or page by directly clicking on the link, it counts as a view. However, if they read the post while looking at your website’s homepage or blog archive page, it won’t count as a view for that specific post or page. Instead, it will only add to the total views of your website. Note: Post and page views count toward your website’s total views, but not all views are tied to a specific post or page URL. Other views, such as category, tag, date, author archive, and search result pages, only count towards total views. In your stats, this appears as “Home page / Archives”. If you have a static front page, any views of that page will be listed under its title. If you have a shop set up through WooCommerce, your shop’s landing page stats will be included in the “Home page / Archives” numbers since the shop page is an archive of your products. Each post or page has a green-tinted bar overlaying its title. The length of the bar shows the percentage of views that post or page got compared to the others listed. The green bars help you see the proportion of each item’s views relative to the others. You can click an item on the list to view additional highlights and insights for that post or page. You can also click View all to see a more comprehensive list. Referrers The Referrers section shows a list of other blogs, websites, and search engines that link to your site. When someone clicks on a link to your website from one of these sources, it counts as a view associated with that referrer. If you see a down arrow next to a referrer, you can click on it to get more specific details. For instance, expanding Search Engines will show more information about particular search engine referrers like Google and Bing. Note: The total number of referrers may not match the total views, as some visitors may come to your site directly by typing the URL, clicking a link in an email, or through another application that opens the browser. Clicking any of the referrer items will take you to the web address displayed. Marking spam referrers Traffic sources differ, and you may consider some referrers to be spam. Internet bots, for example, crawl various websites periodically. While they don’t affect your site’s security, you may not want to include them in your stats. Note: Your stats won’t be affected by marking a referrer as spam. It will only prevent it from showing up in your referrer stats. To mark a referrer as spam: Go to Traffic → Referrers. Hover over the referrer and click the warning symbol next to the URL. Click Mark as Spam. You can mark a referrer as spam by clicking the warning icon highlighted Each referrer on the list has a warning icon next to their view count, except for a few whitelisted ones like WordPress. com. Marking a referrer as spam sends it to a block list for your site, and it won’t appear in the future on your site stats. Note that you cannot undo this action. Views by country The Countries chart shows you how many people from each country have visited your website. This chart allows you to view the number of views your website has received per country. Click View all to see the data on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Note: If a visitor’s location cannot be determined, their views will not be reflected in the chart. This may occur if a visitor is using an incognito browser or VPN, and their location will appear as “Unknown Region” on your Stats page. Authors This allows you to track the amount of traffic generated by each author, which is particularly useful for websites with multiple contributors. By clicking on an author’s name, you can view their most popular posts and pages, as well as the number of views that each has received. Search terms Visitors to your site used these terms, words, and phrases on search engines such as Google, Yahoo, or Bing to discover content on your site. Note: If we don’t know the search terms, we display them as “Unknown search terms.” Certain search engines do not disclose search terms due to privacy concerns. Clicks This chart displays how many times your website visitors clicked on links that take them to other websites. This shows the number of times your website visitors have clicked on external links (links that lead them to other websites). These links may be within your own content, in comments left by your readers, in the names of users who comment on your site, in links to images and media files, and so on. Video views This shows the number of views your Jetpack VideoPress videos have gotten. For a more detailed breakdown of your video stats, click View all at the bottom of the panel. This breakdown contains the following information: Impressions: This refers to how many times a video was loaded. Hours Watched: The total number of hours viewers have watched the video.

To learn more about how to use Jetpack Stats, please see our other support guides. This guide focuses on troubleshooting and frequently asked questions. Can I use other analytics services (like Google Analytics) with Jetpack Stats? Yes! You can use both on your WordPress installation. The benefit of using Jetpack Stats is that you can see a snapshot of your site’s activity right from your dashboard. If you want to use another analytics service to give you additional in-depth information, you can certainly do so. The Stats feature is active, but no visits are being recorded anymore. Jetpack, like many other plugins, uses a function called wp_footer() to insert elements like a Stats tracking code to your site’s footer. This function has to be added to your theme’s footer. php file right before the closing body tag. You can read more about this function in the WordPress documentation. If you’ve recently edited that file, you’ll want to ensure the wp_footer() function is still there. If it is there, you’ll want to check for other code you may have added to your theme (like in your sidebar, for example) that may break everything that comes after. Note: Some GDPR/CCPA Cookie Consent plugins like Complianz can prevent page visit tracking until user consent is provided. That is known to reduce recorded visits. This guide has information on how to disable the Complianz integration with Jetpack. How is traffic counted? The following traffic will not reflect in your stats: Visits you make to your publicly-available site while logged into your admin account. Visits from browsers that do not execute JavaScript or load images. Visits from Googlebot and other search engine spiders. Visits to your publicly available site by registered users that are logged in, and listed as members of the site. Note that this is by default, but you can control which user views get counted in your stats. For information about changing this configuration, see this support guide. I’m a contributor, author, or another non-admin role on the site, and can’t see stats. Ask the admin on the site to change the default setting to allow your user role access to the stats. There’s information about how to enable stats viewing for other roles on the site in this support guide. My stats are at zero, and I lost all my followers! There’s no need to fear; Jetpack is here! We can help reconnect you to your missing stats and followers. Please visit this support page for more information. Can I transfer my followers from WordPress. com to my new Jetpack site? If you’ve moved from WordPress. com to your very own Jetpack-powered site and want to transfer your WordPress. com followers and email subscribers, please use our transfer tool. I just moved my followers from WordPress. com to Jetpack, and the stat counts are different. Why? On WordPress. com, your WordPress. com followers and email followers are counted separately. This means that one person can follow your site on the Reader and receive email notifications when you make a new post which would count them on both lists. On Jetpack, that same follower would only be counted once under WordPress. com Followers on your My Followers list. Why aren’t my site visits updating? I know people are visiting the site! Jetpack stats are updated periodically throughout the day. If you see a problem with your stats not updating, please contact support here. My stats reflect the wrong date and/or time! Our stats get the timezone from WordPress itself, so if your stats appear to be reflecting the wrong date/time, double-check the timezone at Settings -> General in your site’s WP Admin. How do I get more traffic? We have a few tips for attracting more visitors to your site. How do I download my stats? You can download the stats under the “Traffic” tab by following these steps: Click View all under the section of interest. Scroll to the bottom of the page. Click Download data as CSV to download the reports to your computer as a CSV file. For more information, see the Traffic support guide. Why are my VideoPress stats not appearing? VideoPress stats will not be tracked if you are not using the VideoPress player. In accordance with our service guidelines, please make sure your videos are playing only via the VideoPress player and not any other third-party players. I want Jetpack Stats to honor DNT. Do Not Track (DNT) is a feature in web browsers and websites that asks advertisers and other web software providers to not track individuals’ browsing habits. As a site owner, you can force the Jetpack Stats feature to honor any visitors with DNT enabled and not track their activity (i. e. post and page views) by adding the following code snippet to your site: add_filter( 'jetpack_honor_dnt_header_for_stats', '__return_true' ); See this guide for more about adding code snippets to your site. You can find the filter documentation here. We hope to add this as a user-facing setting to the Jetpack Stats in a future release. If you’re using Jetpack to enable Google Analytics on your site, you can force Google Analytics to honor visitors with DNT enabled by adding this code snippet: add_filter( 'jetpack_honor_dnt_header_for_wga', '__return_true' ); Please note that if you choose to honor DNT on an existing site, you may see an obvious decrease in post/page views.","length":5462,"tokens":1203,"chunks":[{"title":"Jetpack Stats: Troubleshooting and FAQs","url":"https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-stats/troubleshooting-and-faqs/","content":"Jetpack Stats: Troubleshooting and FAQs Jetpack Stats provides clear and concise statistics about a website’s visits and traffic.

To see this dashboard, you must be enrolled in WordAds, and it must be enabled on your site following the steps outlined in this support guide. On the “Ads” view, you can find your total earnings and paid amount, as well as ads served, average CPM, and revenue per time period. You can also filter your ads data to focus on daily, weekly, monthly, or annual stats. To access this view: Ensure WordAds is enabled. Go to your site’s WP Admin. Then, go to Jetpack → Stats. Click the Ads tab. Ads stats are collected once a day from the WordAds servers and are not updated in real time. Also, they are estimates and are subject to change. Your earnings are finalized the next month after they were earned. Totals Snapshot of total earnings and amount paid This is a snapshot of total earnings and the amount paid. Any outstanding amount is also shown here. Payments are sent on or about the last day of the following month, so the outstanding amount will show what your site has earned since the last payment. See the WordAds FAQs for more information. Ads served, average CPM, and revenue charts Chart showing show ads served, average CPM, and estimated revenue stats for the selected time period. These bar graphs show ads served, average CPM, and estimated revenue stats. Ads served as shown on this Stats page can be more accurately considered impression opportunities. In other words, these are attempts to show an ad. Interpreting average CPM CPM is cost per thousand impressions or, more literally, cost per mile. Average CPM is an estimate based on past data that gives you an idea of how much you could be making if you continue doing what you are doing, and all factors like traffic, website demographics, niche, and so on remain the same. The average CPM can change, and there is no guarantee that it will stay the same. How much money you make from ads on your website can depend on various factors, such as the content you post, how often it is shared, and how users engage with it. Anything that affects the value of your website to advertisers can impact how much money you make. Viewing a selected time period Hovering over a bar shows the stats for that time period. Like the Traffic dashboard, the graph here shows different time periods, including days, weeks, months, and years. Similarly, the selected time period is highlighted in a different color, and the stats for that period will appear below the graph. Clicking on another bar in the graph will change the information below the graph to reflect the stats for that selected day, week, month, or year period. If you hover your mouse over a bar on the chart, the ads served, average CPM, and revenue data for that time period will pop up, as shown above. Earnings history Each row on the Earnings history table shows earnings and ads served data per month. The Earnings history table shows a full history of your earnings since you enrolled in WordAds. Each row on the table shows earnings per month in addition to ads served that month. The last column tells the status of each earned amount, that is, whether it has been paid or not. Payments go out at the end of the month if they reach the minimum threshold. Ads served refers to the number of ads we attempted to display on your site (page impressions multiplied by available ad slots). Not every ad served will result in a paid impression. This can happen when: A visitor is using an ad blocker, preventing ads from showing. A visitor leaves your site before ads can fully load in their browser.
